            "brief_description": "A high school student who lives alone in a spacious apartment due to his parents' wealth. He considers his next-door neighbor, Mahiru Shiina, to be beautiful, like an angel. He is aware of her popularity and intends to keep his distance to avoid trouble, appreciating her from afar. He is observant, shows concern for Mahiru, and impulsively offered her his umbrella. He catches a cold after being in the rain and is bad at taking care of himself, with a messy apartment and a poor diet. He attempts to downplay his sickness to Mahiru and is embarrassed by the state of his apartment. He is now being cared for by Mahiru, who is concerned about his well-being. He is grateful for Mahiru's care, though he believes she is only helping him out of guilt. He is still recovering from his fever. He is curious about why Mahiru was in the rain and assumes she had a fight with her boyfriend. He realizes he has stepped on a social land mine when he brings up Mahiru having boyfriends and apologizes. He assures Mahiru he wasn't trying to take advantage of her kindness and won't bother her again without a good reason. He reflects on the secret of being nursed back to health by Mahiru, though he finds it a pain to explain. He believes they will return to being mere acquaintances, which is what happens. He is urged by Itsuki to clean his room. He dismisses any possibility of a romantic relationship with Mahiru. He is questioned by Mahiru about his dinner choice of nutritional jelly, expressing concern for his diet. He is aware of his poor living habits and is scolded by Mahiru.

He is now receiving home-cooked meals from Mahiru on a regular basis. He is aware that Mahiru is helping him out of pity. He sarcastically calls Mahiru \"Mom\" after she tells him to eat proper meals and get his life together. He enjoys Mahiru's cooking and returns the container to her the next evening. He is wary of being seen with Mahiru, fearing social repercussions, but is grateful for the food. He buys a bottle of soy sauce for Mahiru at the supermarket. He is aware that Mahiru's feelings toward him are not romantic. He starts fixing microwave packets of rice with each meal because Mahiru's cooking always makes him want rice. He has developed an appetite like never before thanks to Mahiru's cooking and relies on her charity. He acknowledges that Mahiru's care has improved his lifestyle. He feels that Mahiru is meddling in his life, but appreciates her care. He is pale, gangly, and apathetic, resembling a zombie, according to Itsuki. He is unaware of how others perceive him and is surprised to hear that he looks like a corpse. He is supported by his wealthy parents and tries not to waste money. He carries Mahiru's heavy grocery bag and takes the lead, leaving her behind in the supermarket. He is terrible at cleaning, but surprisingly capable of cooking simple meals, albeit with potential for injury. He is also capable of doing laundry. He is at a complete loss on how to start cleaning his apartment. He is ashamed of his messy apartment and feels like Mahiru is a savior. He is aware of his poor living habits and expects Mahiru to give him cleaning tips. He acknowledges his terrible habits and the consequences of not cleaning regularly. He is now being instructed by Mahiru on how to clean his apartment. He is now being directed by Mahiru to sort and discard magazines and clutter.

He is surprised to learn that Mahiru has never ordered pizza. He orders pizza with Mahiru and observes her enjoying it.

He is now receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning from Mahiru, and his apartment remains as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished tidying up the place. He is annoyed by having to witness Itsuki and Chi's flirting. He reveals that his mother is clingy and often checks up on him, which makes him uncomfortable.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student who excels in academics and sports. She is Amane's next-door neighbor and is admired by many. She is reserved and guarded and was found sitting alone in the rain. She is aware of Amane's existence but maintains a guarded distance. She feels responsible for Amane catching a cold and insists on helping him, even entering his messy apartment. She is now actively taking care of Amane, showing concern for his well-being. She is a capable caregiver, providing medicine, cooling sheets, and homemade rice porridge. She is easily flustered and shy around Amane. She is concerned about Amane's health and urges him to rest. She is a good cook and prepares essentials for Amane, such as sports drinks and cooling sheets. She is relieved when Amane enjoys her cooking. She denies having or wanting a boyfriend, which surprises Amane. She is not the kind of girl who would keep the company of several boys at once. She was in the rain to cool her head. She admits she gets annoyed by unwanted attention from guys, revealing a more human side to her. She dislikes being called an \"angel\". She gives Amane a quick bow when they encounter each other. She is seen surrounded by her classmates, smiling and interacting with them. She questions Amane's dinner choice of nutritional jelly, expressing concern for his diet. She brings Amane leftovers, expressing concern for his health and well-being. She criticizes Amane's eating habits and messy room, expressing concern for his well-being. She says she brought leftovers to Amane out of concern for his health and not out of obligation. She tells Amane to eat proper meals and get his life together. She is health-conscious and a skilled cook, making her own dashi stock. She gives Amane another container of food (saut√©ed pork and eggplant), claiming she made too much. She encounters Amane at the supermarket and buys ingredients for dinner. She asks Amane to buy a bottle of soy sauce for her because she is only allowed to buy one at the bargain price. She states that people might get the wrong idea since people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like, but clarifies her feelings toward Amane are not romantic. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices when she can. She is frugal and environmentally conscious. She reflects on the difference between her public persona and her direct manner with Amane. She is one of the people lecturing Amane about cleaning his apartment. She is critical of Amane's messy apartment and offers to help him clean it, expressing her dismay at its filth and his lack of self-care. She emphasizes the importance of routine cleaning. She returns to Amane's apartment wearing comfortable cleaning clothes. She is now directing Amane to clean his apartment thoroughly, starting with the clothes on the floor. She is now directing Amane to sort and discard magazines and clutter, emphasizing efficiency due to time constraints. She slips on a piece of discarded clothing, but Amane catches her. She is unfazed by their close contact. She spent the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and is tired but feels a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant, as her family's help always made the meals. She is from a wealthy family. She orders pizza with Amane and enjoys it with delicate bites. She tells Amane not to stare at her. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was a child. She tells Amane that he makes her stomach turn in knots. She has been scolding Amane, telling him that he has to keep his apartment tidy. Her words make it clear that she actually does care about him, at least a bit. She brings Amane oden, a type of stew, and is glad that Amane can now invite friends over thanks to their cleaning efforts. She shares her meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she likes treating people. She also appreciates his honest feedback on her cooking and was concerned about his eating habits. She is seen sitting on a bench in the park with a stiff posture. She is being careful not to let something show on her face. She looks like she is lost and doesn't know what to do. She sprained her ankle while rescuing a cat from a tree.

      PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
      ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for her to give it to me for free, though.‚Äù He opened the door back into his own place. ‚ÄúWho was it?‚Äù Itsuki asked. ‚ÄúMy neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I‚Äôm gonna put it in the fridge, so don‚Äôt restart the game without me,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúAh, sorry, I already beat the boss.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou gotta be kidding me.‚Äù Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly met for the first time. The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the surrounding apartment buildings were much the same. Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane‚Äôs building was often deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the second time. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing in a place like this?‚Äù he asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Nothing.‚Äù Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn‚Äôt budge at all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over. In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to Mahiru, but the girl‚Äôs voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn‚Äôt seem like Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show on her face. ‚ÄúCome on, if it was nothing, you wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here making that face. Did something happen?‚Äù Amane inquired. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Not really‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the rainstorm, like she was lost and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Seeing her like that worried Amane, but Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem keen to speak on the matter. Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments, Amane hadn‚Äôt been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he‚Äôd seen her all alone in the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her expression was stiff and blank.
Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn‚Äôt feeling up to talking, when he noticed that there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. ‚ÄúYou have some hair stuck to your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down,‚Äù Mahiru explained. ‚ÄúWhat a total clich√©‚Ä¶ Ah, I get it now.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚ÄúWait right there. Don‚Äôt you dare move.‚Äù Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she couldn‚Äôt go anywhere. Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he‚Äôd expected. She hadn‚Äôt so much as shifted. ‚ÄúShiina, take off your tights.‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice. ‚ÄúYeah, I know it‚Äôs kind of sudden‚Ä¶ Look, I‚Äôll put my blazer over you and turn around, so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it.‚Äù As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies. Mahiru‚Äôs face understandably tightened. ‚Äú‚Ä¶How did you know?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn‚Äôt try to stand up. It really is a total clich√© to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, be quiet.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot.‚Äù It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making a sour face, perhaps because she hadn‚Äôt expected him to notice that she was hurt. Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane‚Äôs blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed like she was going to listen to what he was saying.
Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it. After he tied the top shut so it wouldn‚Äôt spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around slowly. Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They were slender and smooth‚Äîand looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural swelling around her ankle was evident. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First of all, this is going to be cold, but let‚Äôs ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little, I‚Äôll put a compress on, so take it easy,‚Äù Amane explained. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom now on, just ask for my help. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll owe me or anything.‚Äù If anything, it‚Äôs the opposite‚ÄîI want to pay you back in some small way for everything you‚Äôve done for me, so I‚Äôd appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you. Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn‚Äôt argue with Amane and quietly let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench. ‚ÄúHas the pain gotten any better?‚Äù Amane asked after a moment. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah, a bit,‚Äù Mahiru replied. ‚ÄúAll right, I‚Äôm putting the compress on, so‚Ä¶don‚Äôt get mad at me for being a perv or a groper or something, okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say something so rude to the person helping me.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood to hear.‚Äù Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to Mahiru‚Äôs leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle. When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would probably remain a minor injury. Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre surprisingly skillful with that,‚Äù she commented. ‚ÄúWell, I can do first aid.

      FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
      He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she‚Äôd brought up his strength, so he smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that. ‚ÄúLook, if you‚Äôre game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back, take your own bag, too, while you‚Äôre at it. I won‚Äôt be able to hold it if I‚Äôm supporting you,‚Äù Amane instructed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Sorry,‚Äù Mahiru muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you: It‚Äôs fine. It wouldn‚Äôt be very manly of me to leave an injured person behind and go home‚Äîor to make you walk.‚Äù Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto Amane‚Äôs back. Mahiru was wearing Amane‚Äôs parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal, but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy. After confirming that Mahiru‚Äôs arms were secured around his neck without choking him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back. I knew it; she‚Äôs so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was. Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for home without showing it. A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn‚Äôt too worried about what little attention was being paid to them. ‚ÄúAll right, here we are.‚Äù Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further. Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some nutritional supplements,‚Äù Amane offered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I have some stuff prepared,‚Äù Mahiru answered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.
See ya.‚Äù That was the most important thing: that food wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. It was essential that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um,‚Äù started Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù When Amane heard the girl‚Äôs voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight into his eyes. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me,‚Äù Mahiru admitted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care.‚Äù Embarrassed by the notion of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind. After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants, but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment without saying anything. ‚ÄúDamn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?‚Äù Amane‚Äôs melancholy in Monday‚Äôs gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the knee. ‚ÄúAs if. I just forgot my pants.‚Äù ‚ÄúIdiot.‚Äù ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù Amane hadn‚Äôt seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he couldn‚Äôt tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back, cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back. Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the other side of the field. What‚Äôs more, since two classes of students were using the field at once, it was fairly crowded.
The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the girls had plenty of time to watch Amane‚Äôs class. ‚ÄúDo your best, Kadowaki!‚Äù Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent their time watching Amane‚Äôs most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki. Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn‚Äôt care for him as much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around. ‚ÄúOh wow, looks like Yuuta‚Äôs as popular as always,‚Äù Itsuki observed. ‚ÄúLooks that way,‚Äù Amane answered dully. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem too interested,‚Äù Itsuki prodded. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre friends or anything; we‚Äôve barely ever spoken. So why should I care?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the minority there, but he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that envying him was pointless. ‚ÄúTypical Amane. What, you don‚Äôt get jealous now?‚Äù Itsuki asked. ‚ÄúOh, should I be like ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm sooo jealous of his populaaarity,‚Äô huh?‚Äù Amane mocked. ‚ÄúThat was pretty good.‚Äù Itsuki guffawed. Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta‚Äôs athletic body and handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling him that. Yuuta rewarded the girls‚Äô passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following. ‚ÄúWell, he sure is popular, no arguing with that,‚Äù admitted Itsuki. ‚ÄúI know. The other guys can‚Äôt contain their jealousy,‚Äù Amane said. ‚ÄúHa-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too.‚Äù Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend, Chitose.

      MAIN TEXT EXCERPT:
      Still can‚Äôt cook, though.‚Äù Amane shrugged, acting a little silly, and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some, even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru‚Äôs slightly softened attitude, Amane pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, handing them to Mahiru. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make that face at me; I don‚Äôt like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And it‚Äôs not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I haven‚Äôt worn them.‚Äù It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone from seeing her underwear. Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she slipped the pants on. Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he‚Äôd been wearing. ‚ÄúHere, wear this,‚Äù he told her. ‚ÄúWait, but why?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you want to be seen being carried?‚Äù Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all. ‚ÄúOh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?‚Äù Amane asked. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt carry you on my back if I‚Äôm wearing it, obviously.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there an option where you don‚Äôt carry me?‚Äù ‚ÄúLook here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one‚Äôs around, and I‚Äôve got perfectly good legs, so please put them to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour legs?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôd prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you even strong enough to carry me all that way?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you making fun of me? ‚Ä¶Well, I‚Äôm actually not that confident.‚Äù Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What‚Äôs more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.
