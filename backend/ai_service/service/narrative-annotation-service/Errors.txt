            "brief_description": "A high school student who lives alone in a spacious apartment due to his parents' wealth. He considers his next-door neighbor, Mahiru Shiina, to be beautiful, like an angel. He is aware of her popularity and intends to keep his distance to avoid trouble, appreciating her from afar. He is observant, shows concern for Mahiru, and impulsively offered her his umbrella. He catches a cold after being in the rain and is bad at taking care of himself, with a messy apartment and a poor diet. He attempts to downplay his sickness to Mahiru and is embarrassed by the state of his apartment. He is now being cared for by Mahiru, who is concerned about his well-being. He is grateful for Mahiru's care, though he believes she is only helping him out of guilt. He is still recovering from his fever. He is curious about why Mahiru was in the rain and assumes she had a fight with her boyfriend. He realizes he has stepped on a social land mine when he brings up Mahiru having boyfriends and apologizes. He assures Mahiru he wasn't trying to take advantage of her kindness and won't bother her again without a good reason. He reflects on the secret of being nursed back to health by Mahiru, though he finds it a pain to explain. He believes they will return to being mere acquaintances, which is what happens. He is urged by Itsuki to clean his room. He dismisses any possibility of a romantic relationship with Mahiru. He is questioned by Mahiru about his dinner choice of nutritional jelly, expressing concern for his diet. He is aware of his poor living habits and is scolded by Mahiru.

He is now receiving home-cooked meals from Mahiru on a regular basis. He is aware that Mahiru is helping him out of pity. He sarcastically calls Mahiru \"Mom\" after she tells him to eat proper meals and get his life together. He enjoys Mahiru's cooking and returns the container to her the next evening. He is wary of being seen with Mahiru, fearing social repercussions, but is grateful for the food. He buys a bottle of soy sauce for Mahiru at the supermarket. He is aware that Mahiru's feelings toward him are not romantic. He starts fixing microwave packets of rice with each meal because Mahiru's cooking always makes him want rice. He has developed an appetite like never before thanks to Mahiru's cooking and relies on her charity. He acknowledges that Mahiru's care has improved his lifestyle. He feels that Mahiru is meddling in his life, but appreciates her care. He is pale, gangly, and apathetic, resembling a zombie, according to Itsuki. He is unaware of how others perceive him and is surprised to hear that he looks like a corpse. He is supported by his wealthy parents and tries not to waste money. He carries Mahiru's heavy grocery bag and takes the lead, leaving her behind in the supermarket. He is terrible at cleaning, but surprisingly capable of cooking simple meals, albeit with potential for injury. He is also capable of doing laundry. He is at a complete loss on how to start cleaning his apartment. He is ashamed of his messy apartment and feels like Mahiru is a savior. He is aware of his poor living habits and expects Mahiru to give him cleaning tips. He acknowledges his terrible habits and the consequences of not cleaning regularly. He is now being instructed by Mahiru on how to clean his apartment. He is now being directed by Mahiru to sort and discard magazines and clutter.

He is surprised to learn that Mahiru has never ordered pizza. He orders pizza with Mahiru and observes her enjoying it.

He is now receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning from Mahiru, and his apartment remains as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished tidying up the place. He is annoyed by having to witness Itsuki and Chi's flirting. He reveals that his mother is clingy and often checks up on him, which makes him uncomfortable.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student who excels in academics and sports. She is Amane's next-door neighbor and is admired by many. She is reserved and guarded and was found sitting alone in the rain. She is aware of Amane's existence but maintains a guarded distance. She feels responsible for Amane catching a cold and insists on helping him, even entering his messy apartment. She is now actively taking care of Amane, showing concern for his well-being. She is a capable caregiver, providing medicine, cooling sheets, and homemade rice porridge. She is easily flustered and shy around Amane. She is concerned about Amane's health and urges him to rest. She is a good cook and prepares essentials for Amane, such as sports drinks and cooling sheets. She is relieved when Amane enjoys her cooking. She denies having or wanting a boyfriend, which surprises Amane. She is not the kind of girl who would keep the company of several boys at once. She was in the rain to cool her head. She admits she gets annoyed by unwanted attention from guys, revealing a more human side to her. She dislikes being called an \"angel\". She gives Amane a quick bow when they encounter each other. She is seen surrounded by her classmates, smiling and interacting with them. She questions Amane's dinner choice of nutritional jelly, expressing concern for his diet. She brings Amane leftovers, expressing concern for his health and well-being. She criticizes Amane's eating habits and messy room, expressing concern for his well-being. She says she brought leftovers to Amane out of concern for his health and not out of obligation. She tells Amane to eat proper meals and get his life together. She is health-conscious and a skilled cook, making her own dashi stock. She gives Amane another container of food (saut√©ed pork and eggplant), claiming she made too much. She encounters Amane at the supermarket and buys ingredients for dinner. She asks Amane to buy a bottle of soy sauce for her because she is only allowed to buy one at the bargain price. She states that people might get the wrong idea since people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like, but clarifies her feelings toward Amane are not romantic. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices when she can. She is frugal and environmentally conscious. She reflects on the difference between her public persona and her direct manner with Amane. She is one of the people lecturing Amane about cleaning his apartment. She is critical of Amane's messy apartment and offers to help him clean it, expressing her dismay at its filth and his lack of self-care. She emphasizes the importance of routine cleaning. She returns to Amane's apartment wearing comfortable cleaning clothes. She is now directing Amane to clean his apartment thoroughly, starting with the clothes on the floor. She is now directing Amane to sort and discard magazines and clutter, emphasizing efficiency due to time constraints. She slips on a piece of discarded clothing, but Amane catches her. She is unfazed by their close contact. She spent the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and is tired but feels a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant, as her family's help always made the meals. She is from a wealthy family. She orders pizza with Amane and enjoys it with delicate bites. She tells Amane not to stare at her. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was a child. She tells Amane that he makes her stomach turn in knots. She has been scolding Amane, telling him that he has to keep his apartment tidy. Her words make it clear that she actually does care about him, at least a bit. She brings Amane oden, a type of stew, and is glad that Amane can now invite friends over thanks to their cleaning efforts. She shares her meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she likes treating people. She also appreciates his honest feedback on her cooking and was concerned about his eating habits. She is seen sitting on a bench in the park with a stiff posture. She is being careful not to let something show on her face. She looks like she is lost and doesn't know what to do. She sprained her ankle while rescuing a cat from a tree.

      PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
      ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for her to give it to me for free, though.‚Äù He opened the door back into his own place. ‚ÄúWho was it?‚Äù Itsuki asked. ‚ÄúMy neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I‚Äôm gonna put it in the fridge, so don‚Äôt restart the game without me,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúAh, sorry, I already beat the boss.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou gotta be kidding me.‚Äù Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly met for the first time. The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the surrounding apartment buildings were much the same. Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane‚Äôs building was often deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the second time. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing in a place like this?‚Äù he asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Nothing.‚Äù Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn‚Äôt budge at all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over. In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to Mahiru, but the girl‚Äôs voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn‚Äôt seem like Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show on her face. ‚ÄúCome on, if it was nothing, you wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here making that face. Did something happen?‚Äù Amane inquired. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Not really‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the rainstorm, like she was lost and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Seeing her like that worried Amane, but Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem keen to speak on the matter. Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments, Amane hadn‚Äôt been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he‚Äôd seen her all alone in the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her expression was stiff and blank.
Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn‚Äôt feeling up to talking, when he noticed that there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. ‚ÄúYou have some hair stuck to your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down,‚Äù Mahiru explained. ‚ÄúWhat a total clich√©‚Ä¶ Ah, I get it now.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚ÄúWait right there. Don‚Äôt you dare move.‚Äù Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she couldn‚Äôt go anywhere. Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he‚Äôd expected. She hadn‚Äôt so much as shifted. ‚ÄúShiina, take off your tights.‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice. ‚ÄúYeah, I know it‚Äôs kind of sudden‚Ä¶ Look, I‚Äôll put my blazer over you and turn around, so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it.‚Äù As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies. Mahiru‚Äôs face understandably tightened. ‚Äú‚Ä¶How did you know?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn‚Äôt try to stand up. It really is a total clich√© to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, be quiet.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot.‚Äù It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making a sour face, perhaps because she hadn‚Äôt expected him to notice that she was hurt. Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane‚Äôs blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed like she was going to listen to what he was saying.
Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it. After he tied the top shut so it wouldn‚Äôt spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around slowly. Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They were slender and smooth‚Äîand looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural swelling around her ankle was evident. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First of all, this is going to be cold, but let‚Äôs ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little, I‚Äôll put a compress on, so take it easy,‚Äù Amane explained. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom now on, just ask for my help. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll owe me or anything.‚Äù If anything, it‚Äôs the opposite‚ÄîI want to pay you back in some small way for everything you‚Äôve done for me, so I‚Äôd appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you. Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn‚Äôt argue with Amane and quietly let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench. ‚ÄúHas the pain gotten any better?‚Äù Amane asked after a moment. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah, a bit,‚Äù Mahiru replied. ‚ÄúAll right, I‚Äôm putting the compress on, so‚Ä¶don‚Äôt get mad at me for being a perv or a groper or something, okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say something so rude to the person helping me.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood to hear.‚Äù Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to Mahiru‚Äôs leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle. When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would probably remain a minor injury. Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre surprisingly skillful with that,‚Äù she commented. ‚ÄúWell, I can do first aid.

      FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
      He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she‚Äôd brought up his strength, so he smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that. ‚ÄúLook, if you‚Äôre game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back, take your own bag, too, while you‚Äôre at it. I won‚Äôt be able to hold it if I‚Äôm supporting you,‚Äù Amane instructed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Sorry,‚Äù Mahiru muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you: It‚Äôs fine. It wouldn‚Äôt be very manly of me to leave an injured person behind and go home‚Äîor to make you walk.‚Äù Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto Amane‚Äôs back. Mahiru was wearing Amane‚Äôs parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal, but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy. After confirming that Mahiru‚Äôs arms were secured around his neck without choking him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back. I knew it; she‚Äôs so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was. Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for home without showing it. A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn‚Äôt too worried about what little attention was being paid to them. ‚ÄúAll right, here we are.‚Äù Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further. Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some nutritional supplements,‚Äù Amane offered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I have some stuff prepared,‚Äù Mahiru answered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.
See ya.‚Äù That was the most important thing: that food wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. It was essential that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um,‚Äù started Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù When Amane heard the girl‚Äôs voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight into his eyes. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me,‚Äù Mahiru admitted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care.‚Äù Embarrassed by the notion of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind. After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants, but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment without saying anything. ‚ÄúDamn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?‚Äù Amane‚Äôs melancholy in Monday‚Äôs gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the knee. ‚ÄúAs if. I just forgot my pants.‚Äù ‚ÄúIdiot.‚Äù ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù Amane hadn‚Äôt seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he couldn‚Äôt tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back, cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back. Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the other side of the field. What‚Äôs more, since two classes of students were using the field at once, it was fairly crowded.
The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the girls had plenty of time to watch Amane‚Äôs class. ‚ÄúDo your best, Kadowaki!‚Äù Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent their time watching Amane‚Äôs most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki. Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn‚Äôt care for him as much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around. ‚ÄúOh wow, looks like Yuuta‚Äôs as popular as always,‚Äù Itsuki observed. ‚ÄúLooks that way,‚Äù Amane answered dully. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem too interested,‚Äù Itsuki prodded. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre friends or anything; we‚Äôve barely ever spoken. So why should I care?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the minority there, but he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that envying him was pointless. ‚ÄúTypical Amane. What, you don‚Äôt get jealous now?‚Äù Itsuki asked. ‚ÄúOh, should I be like ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm sooo jealous of his populaaarity,‚Äô huh?‚Äù Amane mocked. ‚ÄúThat was pretty good.‚Äù Itsuki guffawed. Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta‚Äôs athletic body and handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling him that. Yuuta rewarded the girls‚Äô passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following. ‚ÄúWell, he sure is popular, no arguing with that,‚Äù admitted Itsuki. ‚ÄúI know. The other guys can‚Äôt contain their jealousy,‚Äù Amane said. ‚ÄúHa-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too.‚Äù Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend, Chitose.

      MAIN TEXT EXCERPT:
      Still can‚Äôt cook, though.‚Äù Amane shrugged, acting a little silly, and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some, even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru‚Äôs slightly softened attitude, Amane pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, handing them to Mahiru. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make that face at me; I don‚Äôt like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And it‚Äôs not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I haven‚Äôt worn them.‚Äù It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone from seeing her underwear. Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she slipped the pants on. Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he‚Äôd been wearing. ‚ÄúHere, wear this,‚Äù he told her. ‚ÄúWait, but why?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you want to be seen being carried?‚Äù Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all. ‚ÄúOh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?‚Äù Amane asked. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt carry you on my back if I‚Äôm wearing it, obviously.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there an option where you don‚Äôt carry me?‚Äù ‚ÄúLook here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one‚Äôs around, and I‚Äôve got perfectly good legs, so please put them to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour legs?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôd prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you even strong enough to carry me all that way?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you making fun of me? ‚Ä¶Well, I‚Äôm actually not that confident.‚Äù Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What‚Äôs more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm.

It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning.

It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation.

After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed.

He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed.

Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit.

It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses.

She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed.

She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably.

She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment.

She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her.

            "brief_description": "A high school student who lives alone and is cared for by Mahiru. He appreciates Mahiru's care and is aware of her cold demeanor when discussing relationships. He is now aware that people would curse his name for being undeserving of Mahiru‚Äôs angelic attention. He is perceptive to Mahiru's emotional state and respects her privacy. He is now aware that Mahiru does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. He is now aware of Mahiru's dislike for her birthday and is captivated by her beauty and innocence. He realizes he might be in trouble as he is drawn to her. He is now aware that Shihoko has taken a liking to Mahiru and will likely continue to interfere in their lives. He is surprised to learn that Mahiru is not called by her first name by her parents. He trusts Mahiru and offers her a key to his apartment for convenience. He is now aware that Mahiru is growing more comfortable with their silly banter. He buys Mahiru a shortcake to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. He realizes he has become spoiled by Mahiru's cooking and decides to cook for himself. He acknowledges his overdependence on Mahiru and wants to learn to cook for himself. He is now grateful for Mahiru's help and acknowledges how much she does for him. He acknowledges that he is becoming reliant on Mahiru and wants her to continue cooking for him, admitting it is selfish of him to ask. He agrees to host a Christmas party for Itsuki and Chitose at his apartment but sets conditions on their behavior and departure time. He is now planning to order ready-made food for the party. He is aware that Mahiru used him as an excuse to turn down other dates. He expresses sympathy for Mahiru's situation. He is now forced to invite Mahiru into his apartment after she is spotted on her balcony by Itsuki and Chitose. He is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. He emphasizes the need for Itsuki and Chitose to keep their relationship a secret, fearing potential trouble if word gets out. He is now reminded of his mother due to Chitose's behavior. He intervenes when Chitose gets too close to Mahiru, reminding her to be respectful. He explains Chitose's personality to Mahiru. He is happy to hear that Mahiru sees him as someone she can trust, even though he wishes she hadn't called him incompetent. He admits to Itsuki that he is somewhat interested in Mahiru but believes she only wants a close friend. He is concerned that Chitose might be too persistent with Mahiru and considers cautioning her. He reflects on having his relationship with Mahiru discovered by Itsuki and Chitose, feeling both relieved and wistful. He is impressed by Mahiru's cooking and admits to being ruled by his stomach, finding happiness in her meals. He is selfishly inclined to keep her cooking all to himself. He compliments Mahiru's cooking, saying it tastes like happiness. He is flustered by Mahiru's rare smile and tries to change the subject. He is embarrassed about how much he was looking forward to spending time with Mahiru. He starts teaching Mahiru how to play a 2D game and helps her by physically guiding her through the game. He is flustered when he realizes his hands are almost completely covering Mahiru's, and he quickly pulls away. He finds Mahiru's tilting while playing a racing game adorable. He laughs at Mahiru's tilting and calls her charming. He is aware that Mahiru has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. He feels a strong desire to hold Mahiru close and pet her like a cat, but he restrains himself. He gives Mahiru a leather key holder as a Christmas present. He is not well-versed in fashion and prefers functional clothes. He is shocked that Shihoko sent Mahiru a picture of him from middle school. He is now aware of Mahiru's beauty and finds her appealing. He receives a houndstooth scarf from Mahiru as a Christmas present. He comments on Mahiru's more relaxed demeanor and cuter smiles compared to when they first met. He follows Mahiru onto the veranda and wraps a blanket around her shoulders, expressing concern for her catching a cold. He is reminded of his first encounter with Mahiru, when she nursed him back to health. He expresses gratitude to Mahiru for improving his life and standard of living. He acknowledges Mahiru's positive impact on his life and expresses gratitude for their relationship. He realizes he has taken a liking to their current lifestyle.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments.

She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen. She is now using Amane's spices and has decided on today's dishes. She is perceptive and can guess what Amane is thinking. She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty. She is now feeling extremely wary around people she isn't used to. She shakes Chitose's hand. She is exhausted and confused after dealing with Itsuki and Chitose. She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

            "brief_description": "A high school student who lives alone and is cared for by Mahiru. He appreciates Mahiru's care and is aware of her cold demeanor when discussing relationships. He is now aware that people would curse his name for being undeserving of Mahiru‚Äôs angelic attention. He is perceptive to Mahiru's emotional state and respects her privacy. He is now aware that Mahiru does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. He is now aware of Mahiru's dislike for her birthday and is captivated by her beauty and innocence. He realizes he might be in trouble as he is drawn to her. He is now aware that Shihoko has taken a liking to Mahiru and will likely continue to interfere in their lives. He is surprised to learn that Mahiru is not called by her first name by her parents. He trusts Mahiru and offers her a key to his apartment for convenience. He is now aware that Mahiru is growing more comfortable with their silly banter. He buys Mahiru a shortcake to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation.

He is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. He emphasizes the need for Itsuki and Chitose to keep their relationship a secret, fearing potential trouble if word gets out. He is now reminded of his mother due to Chitose's behavior. He intervenes when Chitose gets too close to Mahiru, reminding her to be respectful. He explains Chitose's personality to Mahiru. He is happy to hear that Mahiru sees him as someone she can trust, even though he wishes she hadn't called him incompetent. He admits to Itsuki that he is somewhat interested in Mahiru but believes she only wants a close friend. He is concerned that Chitose might be too persistent with Mahiru and considers cautioning her. He reflects on having his relationship with Mahiru discovered by Itsuki and Chitose, feeling both relieved and wistful. He is impressed by Mahiru's cooking and admits to being ruled by his stomach, finding happiness in her meals. He is selfishly inclined to keep her cooking all to himself. He compliments Mahiru's cooking, saying it tastes like happiness. He is flustered by Mahiru's rare smile and tries to change the subject. He is embarrassed about how much he was looking forward to spending time with Mahiru. He starts teaching Mahiru how to play a 2D game and helps her by physically guiding her through the game. He is flustered when he realizes his hands are almost completely covering Mahiru's, and he quickly pulls away. He finds Mahiru's tilting while playing a racing game adorable. He laughs at Mahiru's tilting and calls her charming. He is aware that Mahiru has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. He feels a strong desire to hold Mahiru close and pet her like a cat, but he restrains himself. He gives Mahiru a leather key holder as a Christmas present.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people. She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen.

She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship.

She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment.

She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student known for her academic and athletic achievements. She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people.

She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies.

She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane.

She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses.

She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty.

She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

He intervenes when Chitose gets too close to Mahiru, reminding her to be respectful. He explains Chitose's personality to Mahiru. He is happy to hear that Mahiru sees him as someone she can trust, even though he wishes she hadn't called him incompetent. He admits to Itsuki that he is somewhat interested in Mahiru but believes she only wants a close friend. He is concerned that Chitose might be too persistent with Mahiru and considers cautioning her. He reflects on having his relationship with Mahiru discovered by Itsuki and Chitose, feeling both relieved and wistful. He is impressed by Mahiru's cooking and admits to being ruled by his stomach, finding happiness in her meals. He is selfishly inclined to keep her cooking all to himself. He compliments Mahiru's cooking, saying it tastes like happiness. He is flustered by Mahiru's rare smile and tries to change the subject. He is embarrassed about how much he was looking forward to spending time with Mahiru. He starts teaching Mahiru how to play a 2D game and helps her by physically guiding her through the game. He is flustered when he realizes his hands are almost completely covering Mahiru's, and he quickly pulls away. He finds Mahiru's tilting while playing a racing game adorable. He laughs at Mahiru's tilting and calls her charming. He is aware that Mahiru has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. He feels a strong desire to hold Mahiru close and pet her like a cat, but he restrains himself. He gives Mahiru a leather key holder as a Christmas present. He is not well-versed in fashion and prefers functional clothes. He is shocked that Shihoko sent Mahiru a picture of him from middle school. He is now aware of Mahiru's beauty and finds her appealing. He receives a houndstooth scarf from Mahiru as a Christmas present. He comments on Mahiru's more relaxed demeanor and cuter smiles compared to when they first met. He follows Mahiru onto the veranda and wraps a blanket around her shoulders, expressing concern for her catching a cold. He is reminded of his first encounter with Mahiru, when she nursed him back to health. He expresses gratitude to Mahiru for improving his life and standard of living. He acknowledges Mahiru's positive impact on his life and expresses gratitude for their relationship. He realizes he has taken a liking to their current lifestyle. He is plunged into darkness due to a power outage and grabs Mahiru's wrist. He comforts Mahiru during the blackout and notices her flustered reaction when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student known for her academic and athletic achievements. She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people. She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen. She is now using Amane's spices and has decided on today's dishes. She is perceptive and can guess what Amane is thinking. She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty. She is now feeling extremely wary around people she isn't used to. She shakes Chitose's hand. She is exhausted and confused after dealing with Itsuki and Chitose. She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on.
