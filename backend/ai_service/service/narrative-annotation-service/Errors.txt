He considers his next-door neighbor, Mahiru Shiina, to be beautiful, like an angel. He is aware of her popularity and intends to keep his distance to avoid trouble, appreciating her from afar. He is observant, shows concern for Mahiru, and impulsively offered her his umbrella. He catches a cold after being in the rain and is bad at taking care of himself, with a messy apartment and a poor diet. He attempts to downplay his sickness to Mahiru and is embarrassed by the state of his apartment. He is now being cared for by Mahiru, who is concerned about his well-being. He is grateful for Mahiru's care, though he believes she is only helping him out of guilt. He is still recovering from his fever. He is curious about why Mahiru was in the rain and assumes she had a fight with her boyfriend. He realizes he has stepped on a social land mine when he brings up Mahiru having boyfriends and apologizes. He assures Mahiru he wasn't trying to take advantage of her kindness and won't bother her again without a good reason. He reflects on the secret of being nursed back to health by Mahiru, though he finds it a pain to explain. He believes they will return to being mere acquaintances, which is what happens. He is urged by Itsuki to clean his room. He dismisses any possibility of a romantic relationship with Mahiru.

He is now receiving home-cooked meals from Mahiru on a regular basis. He is aware that Mahiru is helping him out of pity. He sarcastically calls Mahiru \"Mom\" after she tells him to eat proper meals and get his life together. He enjoys Mahiru's cooking and returns the container to her the next evening. He is wary of being seen with Mahiru, fearing social repercussions, but is grateful for the food. He buys a bottle of soy sauce for Mahiru at the supermarket. He is aware that Mahiru's feelings toward him are not romantic. He starts fixing microwave packets of rice with each meal because Mahiru's cooking always makes him want rice. He has developed an appetite like never before thanks to Mahiru's cooking and relies on her charity. He acknowledges that Mahiru's care has improved his lifestyle. He feels that Mahiru is meddling in his life, but appreciates her care. He is pale, gangly, and apathetic, resembling a zombie, according to Itsuki. He is unaware of how others perceive him and is surprised to hear that he looks like a corpse. He is supported by his wealthy parents and tries not to waste money. He carries Mahiru's heavy grocery bag and takes the lead, leaving her behind in the supermarket. He is terrible at cleaning, but surprisingly capable of cooking simple meals, albeit with potential for injury. He is also capable of doing laundry. He is at a complete loss on how to start cleaning his apartment. He is ashamed of his messy apartment and feels like Mahiru is a savior. He is aware of his poor living habits and expects Mahiru to give him cleaning tips. He acknowledges his terrible habits and the consequences of not cleaning regularly. He is now being instructed by Mahiru on how to clean his apartment. He is now being directed by Mahiru to sort and discard magazines and clutter.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student who excels in academics and sports. She is Amane's next-door neighbor and is admired by many. She is reserved and guarded and was found sitting alone in the rain. She is aware of Amane's existence but maintains a guarded distance. She feels responsible for Amane catching a cold and insists on helping him, even entering his messy apartment. She is now actively taking care of Amane, showing concern for his well-being. She is a capable caregiver, providing medicine, cooling sheets, and homemade rice porridge. She is easily flustered and shy around Amane. She is concerned about Amane's health and urges him to rest. She is a good cook and prepares essentials for Amane, such as sports drinks and cooling sheets. She is relieved when Amane enjoys her cooking. She denies having or wanting a boyfriend, which surprises Amane. She is not the kind of girl who would keep the company of several boys at once. She was in the rain to cool her head. She admits she gets annoyed by unwanted attention from guys, revealing a more human side to her. She dislikes being called an \"angel\". She gives Amane a quick bow when they encounter each other. She is seen surrounded by her classmates, smiling and interacting with them. She questions Amane's dinner choice of nutritional jelly, expressing concern for his diet. She brings Amane leftovers, expressing concern for his health and well-being. She criticizes Amane's eating habits and messy room, expressing concern for his well-being. She says she brought leftovers to Amane out of concern for his health and not out of obligation. She tells Amane to eat proper meals and get his life together. She is health-conscious and a skilled cook, making her own dashi stock. She gives Amane another container of food (sautéed pork and eggplant), claiming she made too much. She encounters Amane at the supermarket and buys ingredients for dinner. She asks Amane to buy a bottle of soy sauce for her because she is only allowed to buy one at the bargain price. She states that people might get the wrong idea since people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like, but clarifies her feelings toward Amane are not romantic. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices when she can. She is frugal and environmentally conscious. She reflects on the difference between her public persona and her direct manner with Amane. She is one of the people lecturing Amane about cleaning his apartment. She is critical of Amane's messy apartment and offers to help him clean it, expressing her dismay at its filth and his lack of self-care. She emphasizes the importance of routine cleaning. She returns to Amane's apartment wearing comfortable cleaning clothes. She is now directing Amane to clean his apartment thoroughly, starting with the clothes on the floor. She is now directing Amane to sort and discard magazines and clutter, emphasizing efficiency due to time constraints. She slips on a piece of discarded clothing, but Amane catches her. She is unfazed by their close contact. She spent the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and is tired but feels a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant, as her family's help always made the meals. She is from a wealthy family. She orders pizza with Amane and enjoys it with delicate bites. She tells Amane not to stare at her. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was a child. She tells Amane that he makes her stomach turn in knots. She has been scolding Amane, telling him that he has to keep his apartment tidy. Her words make it clear that she actually does care about him, at least a bit. She brings Amane oden, a type of stew, and is glad that Amane can now invite friends over thanks to their cleaning efforts. She shares her meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she likes treating people. She also appreciates his honest feedback on her cooking and was concerned about his eating habits. She is seen sitting on a bench in the park with a stiff posture. She is being careful not to let something show on her face. She looks like she is lost and doesn't know what to do. She sprained her ankle while rescuing a cat from a tree.

      “I still don’t think it’s right for her to give it to me for free, though.” He opened the door back into his own place. “Who was it?” Itsuki asked. “My neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I’m gonna put it in the fridge, so don’t restart the game without me,” Amane replied. “Ah, sorry, I already beat the boss.” “You gotta be kidding me.” Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly met for the first time. The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the surrounding apartment buildings were much the same. Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane’s building was often deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the second time. “What are you doing in a place like this?” he asked. “…Nothing.” Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn’t budge at all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over. In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to Mahiru, but the girl’s voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn’t seem like Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show on her face. “Come on, if it was nothing, you wouldn’t be sitting here making that face. Did something happen?” Amane inquired. “…Not really…” Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the rainstorm, like she was lost and didn’t know what to do. Seeing her like that worried Amane, but Mahiru didn’t seem keen to speak on the matter. Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments, Amane hadn’t been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he’d seen her all alone in the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her expression was stiff and blank.
Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn’t feeling up to talking, when he noticed that there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. “You have some hair stuck to your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?” he asked. “I wasn’t playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down,” Mahiru explained. “What a total cliché… Ah, I get it now.” “Hmm?” “Wait right there. Don’t you dare move.” Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she couldn’t go anywhere. Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he’d expected. She hadn’t so much as shifted. “Shiina, take off your tights.” “Huh?” He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice. “Yeah, I know it’s kind of sudden… Look, I’ll put my blazer over you and turn around, so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it.” As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies. Mahiru’s face understandably tightened. “…How did you know?” “You had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn’t try to stand up. It really is a total cliché to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat.” “Oh, be quiet.” “Yeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot.” It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making a sour face, perhaps because she hadn’t expected him to notice that she was hurt. Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane’s blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed like she was going to listen to what he was saying.
Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it. After he tied the top shut so it wouldn’t spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around slowly. Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They were slender and smooth—and looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural swelling around her ankle was evident. “Well, it’s not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First of all, this is going to be cold, but let’s ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little, I’ll put a compress on, so take it easy,” Amane explained. “…Thank you.” “From now on, just ask for my help. It’s not like you’ll owe me or anything.” If anything, it’s the opposite—I want to pay you back in some small way for everything you’ve done for me, so I’d appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you. Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn’t argue with Amane and quietly let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench. “Has the pain gotten any better?” Amane asked after a moment. “…Yeah, a bit,” Mahiru replied. “All right, I’m putting the compress on, so…don’t get mad at me for being a perv or a groper or something, okay?” “I wouldn’t say something so rude to the person helping me.” “Good to hear.” Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to Mahiru’s leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle. When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would probably remain a minor injury. Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him. “You’re surprisingly skillful with that,” she commented. “Well, I can do first aid.

      FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
      He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she’d brought up his strength, so he smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that. “Look, if you’re game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back, take your own bag, too, while you’re at it. I won’t be able to hold it if I’m supporting you,” Amane instructed. “…Sorry,” Mahiru muttered. “I’m telling you: It’s fine. It wouldn’t be very manly of me to leave an injured person behind and go home—or to make you walk.” Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto Amane’s back. Mahiru was wearing Amane’s parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal, but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy. After confirming that Mahiru’s arms were secured around his neck without choking him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back. I knew it; she’s so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was. Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for home without showing it. A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn’t too worried about what little attention was being paid to them. “All right, here we are.” Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further. Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems. “I don’t need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some nutritional supplements,” Amane offered. “I’m fine. I have some stuff prepared,” Mahiru answered. “That’s good.
See ya.” That was the most important thing: that food wouldn’t be a problem. It was essential that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key. “…Um,” started Mahiru. “Hmm?” When Amane heard the girl’s voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight into his eyes. “…Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me,” Mahiru admitted. “It’s fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care.” Embarrassed by the notion of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind. After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants, but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment without saying anything. “Damn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?” Amane’s melancholy in Monday’s gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the knee. “As if. I just forgot my pants.” “Idiot.” “Shut up.” Amane hadn’t seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he couldn’t tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back, cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back. Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the other side of the field. What’s more, since two classes of students were using the field at once, it was fairly crowded.
The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the girls had plenty of time to watch Amane’s class. “Do your best, Kadowaki!” Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent their time watching Amane’s most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki. Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn’t care for him as much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around. “Oh wow, looks like Yuuta’s as popular as always,” Itsuki observed. “Looks that way,” Amane answered dully. “You don’t seem too interested,” Itsuki prodded. “Well, it’s not like we’re friends or anything; we’ve barely ever spoken. So why should I care?” It wasn’t as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the minority there, but he couldn’t bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that envying him was pointless. “Typical Amane. What, you don’t get jealous now?” Itsuki asked. “Oh, should I be like ‘Wow, I’m sooo jealous of his populaaarity,’ huh?” Amane mocked. “That was pretty good.” Itsuki guffawed. Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta’s athletic body and handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling him that. Yuuta rewarded the girls’ passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following. “Well, he sure is popular, no arguing with that,” admitted Itsuki. “I know. The other guys can’t contain their jealousy,” Amane said. “Ha-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too.” Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend, Chitose.

      MAIN TEXT EXCERPT:
      Still can’t cook, though.” Amane shrugged, acting a little silly, and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some, even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru’s slightly softened attitude, Amane pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack. “Here,” he said, handing them to Mahiru. “What?” she asked. “Don’t make that face at me; I don’t like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And it’s not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I haven’t worn them.” It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone from seeing her underwear. Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she slipped the pants on. Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he’d been wearing. “Here, wear this,” he told her. “Wait, but why?” “Do you want to be seen being carried?” Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all. “Oh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?” Amane asked. “I can’t carry you on my back if I’m wearing it, obviously.” “Is there an option where you don’t carry me?” “Look here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one’s around, and I’ve got perfectly good legs, so please put them to use.” “Your legs?” “What, you’d prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?” “Are you even strong enough to carry me all that way?” “Are you making fun of me? …Well, I’m actually not that confident.” Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What’s more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered.

Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up.

She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach.

The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be.

You can do that, right?” Mahiru asked. “…You’re coming back?” “My conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,” Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. “It’s really a mess in here; there’s nowhere to even step… How can anyone live like this…?” As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. “…What time is it?” Amane asked, confused. “Seven in the evening,” Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. “You slept for several hours.” As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That’s why you got sick, dumbass.” Amane couldn’t really argue with Itsuki’s friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn’t have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What’s more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. “You oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow’s Saturday, so focus on getting better,” Itsuki advised. “I will…,” Amane replied. “If only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.” Itsuki’s lips curled up at his slight boast. “Shut up. I don’t need to hear that from a guy who’s already got a girlfriend.” Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane’s condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he’d let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane’s floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn’t have to, Amane reasoned. “…Really, you don’t need to give it back,” he said aloud. “It’s only natural to return something you borrowed…” Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane’s face. “Um. You have a fever, don’t you…?” “…It’s got nothing to do with you.” Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru —and all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn’t have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. “But you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella…” “That’s totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.” “It most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.” “I said it’s fine, really. It’s not something you need to worry about.” From Amane’s perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn’t want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn’t seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. “…So yeah, it’s all good. See ya.” Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru’s questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn’t break, and he wouldn’t fall. Surely it would catch him, and he’d be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there’s no avoiding it…, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. “…Just as I thought; I can’t leave you alone like this.” Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. “I’ll repay your favor.” Amane’s head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. “I’m going to help you inside. There’s no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.” Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn’t have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn’t until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane’s parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn’t about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn’t have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. “I brought it from home,” she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment—and no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. “…Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.” “It’s fine.” There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru’s curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn’t mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew—and alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. “For the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It’s better to take it with something in your stomach… Are you hungry at all?” Mahiru asked gently. “Mm, a little bit,” Amane answered. “Oh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you’re welcome to have some.” “…Huh, you made it yourself?” “Is there anyone else here but me? If you don’t want it, I’ll eat it all alone.” “No, I’ll eat it! Please let me eat it!” Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he’d never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn’t be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane’s sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. “I’ll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.” “Okay,” Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. “Do it after I leave the room, please.” There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl’s pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn’t thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn’t consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn’t accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru’s alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. …Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he’d also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn’t some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn’t have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. “…Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?” he asked. “Y-you don’t have to tell me,” Mahiru answered dismissively. “I’ll be right back.” She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. …Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must’ve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn’t think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane’s mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. “…I’ve brought the porridge.” At the sound of Mahiru’s concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. “I haven’t taken my temperature yet,” he called back. “I thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though…” “Sorry, I spaced out.” Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn’t bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. “Okay, I’m finished,” Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. “What was your temperature?” she asked. “Thirty-eight point three. I’ll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.” “…Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won’t eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.” Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down—maybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she’d thought it’d be easier on Amane’s stomach. She’d likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn’t steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn’t brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. “Here you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. “This is too pitiful to look at.” The angel, Amane’s savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue—it really was a sorry sight. If he’d known that he’d be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. “First, I’m going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back.

She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly.

She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket.

She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen. She is now using Amane's spices and has decided on today's dishes. She is perceptive and can guess what Amane is thinking. She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane’s immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother.

She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates.

She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day.

She reveals that someone important to her once said ‘Make sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,’ and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid.

She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off.

She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it’s good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That’s what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren’t quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I’m still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I’d admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake’s incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who’s helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who’ve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
“Ah!” Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn’t expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn’t suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. “Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.” He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. “…Mahiru?” he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru’s arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. “What a disgrace…” “…Um, sorry I startled you.” “…No. I startled myself; that’s all.” Mahiru didn’t seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn’t seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane’s shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn’t fall off the sofa.
“Looking for something?” “…Are you being sarcastic?” “Why in the world would I be?” “I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…” “I’m not that much of an ass.” Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane’s shirt, but she didn’t make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. “…So I guess you’re not a big fan of the dark?” He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. “…I don’t hate it, but…” “Mm-hmm?” “…I just don’t like it when it’s bright one moment and dark the next—that’s all.” “Ah, okay.” “I’m not really afraid of the dark, and I don’t feel scared.” “Sure, yeah.” Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, “…There’s just one thing.” He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. “Hmm?” “…When we sit like this, I know I’m not alone, and I feel better,” Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. “I see,” said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. “…The power’s back on. I’m going to check my appliances.” The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane’s hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small “Thank you” and couldn’t help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. “That’s weird,” he muttered as he turned away bashfully. Thank you for buying this ebook, published by Yen On.

She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people. She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen.

She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane’s immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they’d continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty. She is now feeling extremely wary around people she isn't used to. She shakes Chitose's hand. She is exhausted and confused after dealing with Itsuki and Chitose. She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‘Make sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,’ and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it’s good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That’s what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren’t quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I’m still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I’d admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake’s incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who’s helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who’ve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
“Ah!” Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn’t expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn’t suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. “Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.” He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. “…Mahiru?” he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru’s arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. “What a disgrace…” “…Um, sorry I startled you.” “…No. I startled myself; that’s all.” Mahiru didn’t seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn’t seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane’s shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn’t fall off the sofa.
“Looking for something?” “…Are you being sarcastic?” “Why in the world would I be?” “I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…” “I’m not that much of an ass.” Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane’s shirt, but she didn’t make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. “…So I guess you’re not a big fan of the dark?” He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. “…I don’t hate it, but…” “Mm-hmm?” “…I just don’t like it when it’s bright one moment and dark the next—that’s all.” “Ah, okay.” “I’m not really afraid of the dark, and I don’t feel scared.” “Sure, yeah.” Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, “…There’s just one thing.” He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. “Hmm?” “…When we sit like this, I know I’m not alone, and I feel better,” Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. “I see,” said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. “…The power’s back on. I’m going to check my appliances.” The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane’s hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small “Thank you” and couldn’t help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. “That’s weird,” he muttered as he turned away bashfully. Thank you for buying this ebook, published by Yen On.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student known for her academic and athletic achievements. She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people. She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane.

She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing.

She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses.

She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed.

She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother.

She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food.

She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day.

She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‘Make sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,’ and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it’s good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That’s what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren’t quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I’m still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I’d admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake’s incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who’s helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who’ve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
“Ah!” Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn’t expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn’t suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. “Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.” He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. “…Mahiru?” he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru’s arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. “What a disgrace…” “…Um, sorry I startled you.” “…No. I startled myself; that’s all.” Mahiru didn’t seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn’t seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane’s shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn’t fall off the sofa.
“Looking for something?” “…Are you being sarcastic?” “Why in the world would I be?” “I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…” “I’m not that much of an ass.” Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane’s shirt, but she didn’t make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. “…So I guess you’re not a big fan of the dark?” He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. “…I don’t hate it, but…” “Mm-hmm?” “…I just don’t like it when it’s bright one moment and dark the next—that’s all.” “Ah, okay.” “I’m not really afraid of the dark, and I don’t feel scared.” “Sure, yeah.” Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, “…There’s just one thing.” He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. “Hmm?” “…When we sit like this, I know I’m not alone, and I feel better,” Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. “I see,” said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. “…The power’s back on. I’m going to check my appliances.” The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane’s hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small “Thank you” and couldn’t help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. “That’s weird,” he muttered as he turned away bashfully. Thank you for buying this ebook, published by Yen On.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student known for her academic and athletic achievements. She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would.

She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies.

She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane.

She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses.

She is shocked at Amane’s immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed.

She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they’d continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty. She is now feeling extremely wary around people she isn't used to. She shakes Chitose's hand. She is exhausted and confused after dealing with Itsuki and Chitose. She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‘Make sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,’ and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

He is now aware that people would curse his name for being undeserving of Mahiru’s angelic attention. He is perceptive to Mahiru's emotional state and respects her privacy. He is now aware that Mahiru does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. He is now aware of Mahiru's dislike for her birthday and is captivated by her beauty and innocence. He realizes he might be in trouble as he is drawn to her. He is now aware that Shihoko has taken a liking to Mahiru and will likely continue to interfere in their lives. He is surprised to learn that Mahiru is not called by her first name by her parents. He trusts Mahiru and offers her a key to his apartment for convenience. He is now aware that Mahiru is growing more comfortable with their silly banter. He buys Mahiru a shortcake to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. He realizes he has become spoiled by Mahiru's cooking and decides to cook for himself. He acknowledges his overdependence on Mahiru and wants to learn to cook for himself. He is now grateful for Mahiru's help and acknowledges how much she does for him. He acknowledges that he is becoming reliant on Mahiru and wants her to continue cooking for him, admitting it is selfish of him to ask. He agrees to host a Christmas party for Itsuki and Chitose at his apartment but sets conditions on their behavior and departure time. He is now planning to order ready-made food for the party. He is aware that Mahiru used him as an excuse to turn down other dates. He expresses sympathy for Mahiru's situation. He is now forced to invite Mahiru into his apartment after she is spotted on her balcony by Itsuki and Chitose. He is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they’d continued seeing each other. He emphasizes the need for Itsuki and Chitose to keep their relationship a secret, fearing potential trouble if word gets out. He is now reminded of his mother due to Chitose's behavior. He intervenes when Chitose gets too close to Mahiru, reminding her to be respectful. He explains Chitose's personality to Mahiru. He is happy to hear that Mahiru sees him as someone she can trust, even though he wishes she hadn't called him incompetent. He admits to Itsuki that he is somewhat interested in Mahiru but believes she only wants a close friend. He is concerned that Chitose might be too persistent with Mahiru and considers cautioning her. He reflects on having his relationship with Mahiru discovered by Itsuki and Chitose, feeling both relieved and wistful. He is impressed by Mahiru's cooking and admits to being ruled by his stomach, finding happiness in her meals. He is selfishly inclined to keep her cooking all to himself. He compliments Mahiru's cooking, saying it tastes like happiness. He is flustered by Mahiru's rare smile and tries to change the subject. He is embarrassed about how much he was looking forward to spending time with Mahiru. He starts teaching Mahiru how to play a 2D game and helps her by physically guiding her through the game. He is flustered when he realizes his hands are almost completely covering Mahiru's, and he quickly pulls away. He finds Mahiru's tilting while playing a racing game adorable. He laughs at Mahiru's tilting and calls her charming. He is aware that Mahiru has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. He feels a strong desire to hold Mahiru close and pet her like a cat, but he restrains himself. He gives Mahiru a leather key holder as a Christmas present. He is not well-versed in fashion and prefers functional clothes. He is shocked that Shihoko sent Mahiru a picture of him from middle school. He is now aware of Mahiru's beauty and finds her appealing. He receives a houndstooth scarf from Mahiru as a Christmas present. He comments on Mahiru's more relaxed demeanor and cuter smiles compared to when they first met. He follows Mahiru onto the veranda and wraps a blanket around her shoulders, expressing concern for her catching a cold. He is reminded of his first encounter with Mahiru, when she nursed him back to health. He expresses gratitude to Mahiru for improving his life and standard of living. He acknowledges Mahiru's positive impact on his life and expresses gratitude for their relationship. He realizes he has taken a liking to their current lifestyle. He is plunged into darkness due to a power outage and grabs Mahiru's wrist. He comforts Mahiru during the blackout and notices her flustered reaction when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it’s good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That’s what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren’t quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I’m still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I’d admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake’s incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who’s helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who’ve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
“Ah!” Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn’t expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn’t suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. “Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.” He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. “…Mahiru?” he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru’s arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. “What a disgrace…” “…Um, sorry I startled you.” “…No. I startled myself; that’s all.” Mahiru didn’t seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn’t seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane’s shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn’t fall off the sofa.
“Looking for something?” “…Are you being sarcastic?” “Why in the world would I be?” “I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…” “I’m not that much of an ass.” Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane’s shirt, but she didn’t make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. “…So I guess you’re not a big fan of the dark?” He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. “…I don’t hate it, but…” “Mm-hmm?” “…I just don’t like it when it’s bright one moment and dark the next—that’s all.” “Ah, okay.” “I’m not really afraid of the dark, and I don’t feel scared.” “Sure, yeah.” Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, “…There’s just one thing.” He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. “Hmm?” “…When we sit like this, I know I’m not alone, and I feel better,” Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. “I see,” said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. “…The power’s back on. I’m going to check my appliances.” The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane’s hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small “Thank you” and couldn’t help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. “That’s weird,” he muttered as he turned away bashfully. Thank you for buying this ebook, published by Yen On.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student known for her academic and athletic achievements. She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people. She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen. She is now using Amane's spices and has decided on today's dishes. She is perceptive and can guess what Amane is thinking. She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane’s immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they’d continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty. She is now feeling extremely wary around people she isn't used to. She shakes Chitose's hand. She is exhausted and confused after dealing with Itsuki and Chitose. She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‘Make sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,’ and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it’s good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That’s what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren’t quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I’m still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I’d admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake’s incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we’ve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who’s helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who’ve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
“Ah!” Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn’t expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn’t suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. “Do you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.” He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. “…Mahiru?” he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru’s arm… It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. “What a disgrace…” “…Um, sorry I startled you.” “…No. I startled myself; that’s all.” Mahiru didn’t seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn’t seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane’s shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn’t fall off the sofa.
“Looking for something?” “…Are you being sarcastic?” “Why in the world would I be?” “I thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout…” “I’m not that much of an ass.” Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily—but she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane’s shirt, but she didn’t make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. “…So I guess you’re not a big fan of the dark?” He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. “…I don’t hate it, but…” “Mm-hmm?” “…I just don’t like it when it’s bright one moment and dark the next—that’s all.” “Ah, okay.” “I’m not really afraid of the dark, and I don’t feel scared.” “Sure, yeah.” Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, “…There’s just one thing.” He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. “Hmm?” “…When we sit like this, I know I’m not alone, and I feel better,” Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. “I see,” said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. “…The power’s back on. I’m going to check my appliances.” The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane’s hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small “Thank you” and couldn’t help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. “That’s weird,” he muttered as he turned away bashfully. Thank you for buying this ebook, published by Yen On.

Appendix Afterword Yen Newsletter Stay up to date On Light Novels by Downloading our mobile App Zerobooks Android Zerobooks IOS Download all your Favorite Light Novels Jnovels.com Prologue Preparing the Perfect Stage! I honestly can’t remember what catalyzed this desire. All I know is I’ve admired shadowbrokers for as long as I can remember. Was it a certain anime? Or was it a manga—or a movie? Eh, I guess it doesn’t matter. I was all in for anything that featured a mastermind, or an eminence in shadow as I like to call them. These characters were never the protagonists or ﬁnal bosses but were relegated to a role behind the scenes where they ﬂaunted their powers and meddled in the aﬀairs of others. I’ve always looked up to the men in the shadows. I wanted to be one of them. Think of children who worship their favorite superheroes. That was me but with master puppeteers. Well, there was one thing that set us apart: My reverence for them wasn’t short-lived. In fact, it buried itself deeper in my heart, never dying out and always guiding me through life. To become stronger, I learned everything from karate to boxing, from swordplay to mixed martial arts. I hammed it up during all my practices, concealing my true power from the world and preparing for the fated day. At school, I played the part of being pleasantly mediocre, an unassuming face in the crowd. Like an NPC in a game or a part of the mob. I didn’t do any harm. But behind this facade of normalcy, I was training full throttle. That’s how I spent my entire youth. But as time passed, an uneasy feeling started to haunt me: I was due for a reality check. Yeah, that’s right. This was all for nothing. I realized I’d never become as powerful as shadow commanders in the stories. It didn’t matter how hard I trained in martial arts. Sure, I could clobber a few punks…but that was it. It’d be a tough ﬁght if anyone drew a gun, and if I was surrounded by soldiers in full gear, I’d be toast, donezo, old news. The idea of a shadowbroker getting curb stomped by some soldiers… Ha! Ridiculous!

      I pick up and put on my underwear, which I’d chucked to the side, and wiggle my arms through the sleeves of my school uniform. I have yet to pick up these secret magical skills, but I’ve been starting to feel the eﬀects of my training, I think, of late. Like right now. I can see ﬂashing lights going oﬀ in my mind and sense the world is spinning. It could be magic…or auras… In either case, I’m feeling its eﬀects—that’s for sure. I’m proud to announce that I’ve completed another successful session. When I’m in the thick of it, I rip oﬀ every single article of clothing and get buck naked in the forest. It makes me one with the universe. I bash my skull into the trunk of a giant tree to physically force out my worldly thoughts. Plus, it stimulates my brain and urges my latent powers to awaken. You know, I’m all about logic when it comes to these things. Yeah, everything’s beginning to get all blurry right about now. It’s a sensation comparable to giving myself a concussion. I make my way out of the forest with the lightest of footsteps, feeling like I’m treading on clouds. Just then, I see light—two beams ﬂoating in the air and slicing through space. How strange. They’re beckoning me, guiding me somewhere. “Ma-magic…?” I whisper, tiptoeing toward the illumination. It must be… It’s gotta be! I ﬁnally found the powers of the unknown! I notice that I’ve gone from walking to sprinting, tripping over the roots of trees and continuing to stagger forward—on and on like a beast in the forest. “Magic! Magic! Magic! MAGIC, MAGIC, MAGIC!!!!!” I chant, bounding toward the lights and ready to snatch them out of midair… “Hmm…?” As a pair of headlights ﬂood my vision with a blinding whiteness, I hear the shrill whine of a sudden brake ringing and ringing. And then a collision. Its impact pierces through my body… And my magic… In conclusion, I was able to ﬁnd magical powers. When I open my eyes, I sense that I’m surrounded by its energy, though I gotta admit it looks diﬀerent from the two lights. Eh, no biggie. Oh, and one other small detail: As a side eﬀect, I manage to reincarnate. I bet I opened a door to another world when I found magic or something. Whatever.
As for right now, I’m a baby boy, a few months old. I only recently started forming thoughts, but it’s still hard for me to guess how much time has elapsed at any given moment. Plus, I don’t know any words, but I guess it’s plenty to recognize that this civilization is more or less the same as Europe in the Middle Ages. But none of that’s important. I’ve acquired magical powers. That’s the end-all be-all. I couldn’t care less about how it happened or any bonus features. I notice magic as soon as I start displaying glimmers of consciousness. All around me, I can see minuscule grains of light ﬂoating and shimmering. It reminds me of those times in my past life when I frolicked through a ﬁeld of ﬂowers stark naked—to train and ﬁnd spirits, obviously. As it turns out, my training wasn’t a total waste after all. I mean, my ability to detect this energy is proof enough, and I can control it as easily as my limbs. It’s comparable to when I strapped my naked body to a cross, a nod to Jesus…or maybe when I ﬂip- ﬂopped religions and danced around in prayer in my birthday suit… I bet every little thing in my training sessions helped me in the long run. It’s already taught me that I can get stronger. Plus, time is of no consequence for a baby. I’m ready to use these years to train and become an eminence in shadow, once and for all… Oops, I think I’ve made a doodie. Which reminds me. I heard somewhere that birds let their droppings dribble out involuntarily, and I think human babies are the same. I can ﬁght the good ﬁght with logic and reasoning, but it feels as though my instincts take over, whispering Just do it in my ear. That said, this is me we’re talking about. I spent my waking hours training in my past life. Pooling together all the strength in my body, I tighten my sphincter, buying me some time… “Wwwaaaahhhhh!” …to summon people. I think it’s been ten years. You know, magic is something else. It means I can surpass the bodily limitations of humans: lift ginormous boulders with a single ﬁnger, dash twice as fast as a horse, leap higher than a house. That said, I’m no match for nukes.
Well, I know my defenses will increase with my magical capacity, but have you seen the ﬁrepower of those weapons on Earth? There was a time when I contemplated forgetting about them entirely, ’cause we don’t have nukes in this world. But what good is a master puppeteer who settles for less? No good. Not at all. That means my next mission is to become strong enough to beat weapons of mass destruction. After extensive research and training, I found one potential solution, which I’ve been incorporating into my daily experiments. Oh yeah. And it seems I’ve been born into a noble family. For generations, members of this family have trained to become dark knights, who use magic to power up and slay enemies in battle. And as my family’s rising star of a son (…NOT), I’m living my days as your average apprentice. After all, shadowbrokers need to be extremely selective about when, where, and to whom they reveal their powers. Yeah…I’ll lie in wait until then. I know I’m not exerting my true potential and that I am cutting corners, but I learned some skills as an apprentice that have come in handy. Like how magic is used on the battleﬁeld in this world. It’s been a good opportunity for me to reﬂect on my own techniques. To be completely honest, it’s clear to me the ﬁghting styles from my past life were a hundred times more logical and reﬁned than the ones here. I mean, look at any contemporary martial arts battle. These ﬁghters rebuke unnecessary movements, drawing from various combat schools and whittling them down to the crème de la crème. This creates the conditions for the “perfect” ﬁght. It relies on the rules of the game, of course, but this mental attitude can be used to identify the best of the best in any situation. And then consider this world. First and foremost, their ﬁghting techniques stay in their country of origin. Which means diﬀerent schools of combat don’t cross borders. Plus, there are certain secret skills that countries won’t allow out of their jurisdiction—not that we’d be able to spread them to begin with, since no forms of media are readily available to us. This means we can’t combine techniques from other forms of ﬁghting, much less reject or improve our own.

      MAIN TEXT EXCERPT:
      Let’s say I trained for ten more years—or that I became the greatest martial artist in the world. I’d still get rekt by a gang of commandos. Or maybe I’d manage to escape by the skin of my teeth or train hard enough to ﬁght back. It’s all in the realm of possibility. But even if I somehow managed to do that, these guys could set oﬀ a nuke and vaporize me in an instant. There is a limit to the human body. That much I know. That said, my master puppeteers would never be taken down by a nuke. Which means I needed to be impervious to them, too. What does one need to survive a nuclear attack? Is it the ability to pack a punch? Could it be a body of steel? How about unlimited stamina? Wrong, wrong, and wrong again. You need a totally diﬀerent kind of power. Some call it magic. Others, mana. Or chi, or aura, or…you get the point. Anything will do. I needed to obtain this clandestine ability. I’d managed to reach this conclusion when I ﬁnally confronted reality head-on. I’ll try to explain. Let’s say someone is on a quest for magical powers. Anyone would think they’re nuts. Hell, I know I would. I’d think they’d gone bonkers. But consider this: No one in the world has proved that magic exists—or disproved it. I couldn’t ﬁnd these powers with my sanity intact. I had to dive to the depths of lunacy. I started training in a new way that was damn near impossible. After all, no one knows how to acquire magic, mana, chi, auras, or what have you. I practiced Zen meditation; I braved the puriﬁcation ceremony of standing under waterfalls; I focused my entire being inward; I fasted; I mastered the art of yoga; I converted religions; I searched for holy spirits; I prayed to god; I strapped myself to a cross. There was no right answer, which meant I groped my way through the darkness and sprinted down my chosen path. Which brings us here. I’m just about ready to start my ﬁnal summer as a high schooler, and I’ve yet to discover magic or mana or chi or auras… It is already dark by the time I ﬁnish my daily training session.

He resembles his father, with a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair. He is greedy and prone to tantrums when he feels he is not getting enough. He pretends to cry to get his way. He throws a tantrum when his knickerbocker glory isn't big enough. He wants to see the big, poisonous snakes at the zoo and whines at his father to make the snake move. He exaggerates the snake's aggression after its escape. He breaks his new cine-camera, crashes his remote-control airplane, and knocks down Mrs. Figg on his racing bike. He is the leader of his gang and enjoys Harry-hunting. He is attending Smeltings and wears a maroon tailcoat, orange knickerbockers, and a flat straw hat called a boater. He carries his Smeltings stick everywhere. He is curious about Harry's letter and tries to read it. He throws a tantrum when Harry is moved into his second bedroom. He is sent to get the mail by Uncle Vernon, and finds another letter for Harry. He gets hit by the Smeltings stick during a fight over the letter. He is amazed that someone wants to talk to Harry so badly. He is taken away by the Dursleys to escape the letters. He is hit around the head by his father for trying to pack his television, video and computer in his sports bag. He is taken to a shack on a rock in the sea by the Dursleys, and complains that he cannot watch 'The Great Humberto' on television. He is given a bed on the moth-eaten sofa in the shack. He is woken up by the knocking on the door of the shack and asks where the cannon is. He hides behind his mother, terrified. He fidgets when Hagrid is cooking sausages. He is given a pig's tail by Hagrid.",

He was increasingly worried about the connection between the Potters and the strange events occurring and hopes to avoid any involvement with them. He indulges Dudley's desires and admires his son's greed. He tells Harry to comb his hair and warns him against any 'funny business'. He enjoys complaining about various things, including Harry and motorbikes. He taps on the glass at the zoo to try and make the snake move. He is furious about the snake incident and punishes Harry. He is proud of Dudley in his Smeltings uniform. He is alarmed and terrified by Harry's letter and prevents him from reading it. He burns Harry's letter and moves him to Dudley's second bedroom. He wrestles Dudley to get the new letter addressed to Harry. He sleeps in front of the door to prevent Harry from getting the mail and nails up the letter-box. He tears the letters into pieces and nails up the letterbox. He hums 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' and boards up the doors. He makes furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy. He seizes Harry and throws him into the hall. He decides to leave. He drives aimlessly, ending up in various locations, trying to shake off the letters. He hits Dudley round the head for trying to pack his television, video and computer in his sports bag. He drives his family to a shack on a rock in the sea to escape the letters. He is in a good mood, thinking no one can reach them to deliver post. He brings a rifle with him to the shack. He is disarmed by Hagrid, who bends the rifle into a knot. He tells Dudley not to touch anything Hagrid gives him. He whispers 'Mimblewimble' when Hagrid is angry. He forbids Hagrid from telling Harry anything. He is ashen-faced and angry, and tries to stop Harry from going with Hagrid. He dismisses Hagrid's story as rubbish. He expresses his belief that Harry is strange and that his parents were weirdos who deserved their fate. He is silenced by Hagrid's threat. He insists that Harry will attend Stonewall High and not Hogwarts, leading to a confrontation with Hagrid. He is terrified of Hagrid.",

        Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.’ He turned to Griphook. ‘Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?’ ‘One speed only,’ said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. DIAGON ALLEY 59 They went rattling over an underground ravine and Harry leant over the side to try and see what was down at the dark bottom but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. ‘Stand back,’ said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. ‘If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,’ said Griphook. ‘How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?’ Harry asked. ‘About once every ten years,’ said Griphook, with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top- security vault, Harry was sure, and he leant forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least – but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. ‘Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,’ said Hagrid. * One wild cart-ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight out- side Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life – more money than even Dudley had ever had. ‘Might as well get yer uniform,’ said Hagrid, nodding towards Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. ‘Listen, Harry would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.’ He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. ‘Hogwarts, dear?’ she said, when Harry started to speak. ‘Got the lot here – another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.’ In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length. 60 HARRY POTTER ‘Hullo,’ said the boy, ‘Hogwarts too?’ ‘Yes,’ said Harry. ‘My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the street looking at wands,’ said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. ‘Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don’t see why first-years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully father into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.’ Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. ‘Have you got your own broom?’ the boy went on. ‘No,’ said Harry. ‘Play Quidditch at all?’ ‘No,’ Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. ‘I do – Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you’ll be in yet?’ ‘No,’ said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. ‘Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been – imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?’ ‘Mmm,’ said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. ‘I say, look at that man!’ said the boy suddenly, nodding towards the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice-creams to show he couldn’t come in. ‘That’s Hagrid,’ said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn’t. ‘He works at Hogwarts.’ ‘Oh,’ said the boy, ‘I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant, isn’t he?’ ‘He’s the gamekeeper,’ said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. ‘Yes, exactly.
I heard he’s a sort of savage – lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed.’ ‘I think he’s brilliant,’ said Harry coldly. ‘Do you?’ said the boy, with a slight sneer. ‘Why is he with you? Where are your parents?’ ‘They’re dead,’ said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like going into the matter with this boy. ‘Oh, sorry,’ said the other, not sounding sorry at all. ‘But they DIAGON ALLEY 61 were our kind, weren’t they?’ ‘They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.’ ‘I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?’ But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, ‘That’s you done, my dear,’ and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. ‘Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,’ said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice-cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). ‘What’s up?’ said Hagrid. ‘Nothing,’ Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed colour as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, ‘Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?’ ‘Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know – not knowin’ about Quidditch!’ ‘Don’t make me feel worse,’ said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s. ‘– and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be allowed in –’ ‘Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were – he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk – you saw ’em in the Leaky Cauldron. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’ Muggles – look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!’ ‘So what is Quidditch?’ ‘It’s our sport. Wizard sport.

        Outside the apothecary’s, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again. ‘Just yer wand left – oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birth- day present.’ Harry felt himself go red. ‘You don’t have to –’ ‘I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at – an’ I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer post an’ everythin’.’ DIAGON ALLEY 63 Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage which held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. ‘Don’ mention it,’ said Hagrid gruffly. ‘Don’ expect you’ve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now – only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.’ A magic wand ... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single spindly chair which Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions which had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. ‘Good afternoon,’ said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. ‘Hello,’ said Harry awkwardly. ‘Ah yes,’ said the man. ‘Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.’ It wasn’t a question. ‘You have your mother’s eyes.
It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.’ Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. ‘Your father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for trans- figuration. Well, I say your father favoured it – it’s really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.’ Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were 64 HARRY POTTER almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. ‘And that’s where ...’ Mr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with a long, white finger. ‘I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,’ he said softly. ‘Thirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... Well, if I’d known what that wand was going out into the world to do ...’ He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid. ‘Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again ... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?’ ‘It was, sir, yes,’ said Hagrid. ‘Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?’ said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern. ‘Er – yes, they did, yes,’ said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. ‘I’ve still got the pieces, though,’ he added brightly. ‘But you don’t use them?’ said Mr Ollivander sharply. ‘Oh, no, sir,’ said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. ‘Hmmm,’ said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. ‘Well, now – Mr Potter. Let me see.’ He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. ‘Which is your wand arm?’ ‘Er – well, I’m right-handed,’ said Harry. ‘Hold out your arm. That’s it.’ He measured Harry from shoul- der to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, ‘Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same.
And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.’ Harry suddenly realised that the tape measure, which was meas- uring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. ‘That will do,’ he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. ‘Right then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.’ Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a DIAGON ALLEY 65 bit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. ‘Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try –’ Harry tried – but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr Ollivander. ‘No, no – here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.’ Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. ‘Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere – I wonder, now – yes, why not – unusual combi- nation – holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.’ Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried, ‘Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ...’ He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, ‘Curious ... curious ...’ ‘Sorry,’ said Harry, ‘but what’s curious?’ Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. ‘I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather – just one other.

        It’s like – like football in the Muggle world – everyone follows Quidditch – played up in the air on broomsticks and there’s four balls – sorta hard ter explain the rules.’ ‘And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?’ ‘School houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o’ duffers, but –’ ‘I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,’ said Harry gloomily. ‘Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,’ said Hagrid darkly. ‘There’s 62 HARRY POTTER not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.’ ‘Vol– sorry – You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?’ ‘Years an’ years ago,’ said Hagrid. They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. ‘I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.’ ‘I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,’ said Hagrid. ‘An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet, yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.’ Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (‘It says pewter on yer list’), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the apothecary’s, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor, jars of herbs, dried roots and bright powders lined the walls, bundles of feath- ers, strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

            "brief_description": "A tall and muscular swordswoman with animal-like ears and a tail, and dark brown skin. Known as a Sword King, she is highly skilled in the Sword God Style. She accompanies Rudeus and is his sword instructor and travel companion. She swiftly kills the two kidnappers. She was an adventurer in the past and shares her experiences to motivate Eris to learn. She describes her old adventuring party and their roles. She explains the difference between warriors, swordsmen, and knights. She uses the Sword of Light technique. She is able to influence Eris to attend all her lessons. Rudeus seeks her help to convince Eris of the importance of learning division. She recounts a story of surviving in a labyrinth by eating demon feces, which impresses Eris and motivates her to learn division. She provides explicit instructions and advice to Rudeus and Eris during sword practice. She is a good teacher, pointing out faults in explicit detail and giving advice. She identifies Paul as an 'instinctive type' of teacher. She believes that diligent work and talent are important for success, and that mastering the essentials is key to reaching an advanced skill level. She was once an instinctive type but became King-tier by using her head and thinking logically. She attends a staff meeting with Rudeus and Edna. She insists on accompanying Rudeus and Eris to Roa as Eris's bodyguard. She is protective of Eris. She is reliable and has good hearing. She doesn't understand the usefulness of knowing the prices of things. She identifies the floating castle as the Armored Dragon King Perugius's fortress. She attempts to explain Perugius's identity to Rudeus. She has difficulty learning magic and can only perform fire spells. She is standing guard at Eris's birthday party and has drool dripping off her chin. Rudeus sends food to her. She is invited to Rudeus's room after the party. She drinks wine with Rudeus and Eris, ignoring the legal drinking age. She kneels and respectfully accepts a wand from Rudeus, following Sword God Style tradition. She gives Eris a talisman ring passed down in her clan that protects the bearer from being attacked by bad wolves at night. She almost tells a story about Paul. She assists Rudeus in learning the Beast God tongue. She is considered the fourth strongest person in the Sword God Style. She respects Rudeus and sees him as a capable individual. She is impressed by Rudeus's ability to fight and teach. She is learning basic fire and water magic from Rudeus and is now learning to cast spells without chanting. She acknowledges Rudeus's teaching style is similar to her sword master's, which focuses on logical foundations. She believes Rudeus inherited his refusal to quit from his father, Paul. She eventually wants to teach Rudeus a technique to defeat Paul, but Rudeus has no talent for the Sword God Style. She initially underestimated Rudeus, but has come to respect his abilities as a tutor and fighter. She was saved from starvation by Sauros and Eris after being defrauded. She respects Rudeus for his teaching abilities. She believes Paul was good for something because Rudeus gained the ability to move strategically in a swordfight as a result of fighting him. She thinks it is pathetic that Roxy ran from her problems, but is also thankful that she was taught magic by her by proxy. She initially thought Rudeus was a gentleman, but now believes he will become a womanizer. She is ignorant in the affairs of love. She reflects on Eris's growth and attributes it to her desire to impress Rudeus. She had a troublesome childhood herself. She is starting to understand the usefulness of knowing the prices of things. She is helping Eris train in swordplay and believes she could reach Saint-tier. She plans to introduce Eris and Rudeus to her master if Eris continues to improve. She is involved in planning a surprise party for Rudeus's tenth birthday. She is unusually nervous and attempts to keep Rudeus in his room by asking him to demonstrate Saint-tier magic. She is oddly excited about Rudeus's Saint-tier magic. She allows Rudeus to touch her muscular behind to examine the base of her tail. She expresses her desire for a figure that captures her current physique. She claps for Rudeus at his surprise birthday party. She carries Eris to her room after she falls asleep. She is deeply interested in Rudeus's magic. She advises against returning to the city due to the mana concentration. She defends Rudeus from a mysterious attacker, using the Longsword of Light technique. She clashes blades with Arumanfi, revealing his name and allegiance to Perugius. She convinces Arumanfi that they are not responsible for the phenomenon by swearing on her master and household and showing him her sword, Hiramune-Flat Core. She is swallowed by the light as the Fittoa Region vanishes. Her name is listed in the missing persons column. She reappears in the Ejin Forest after being transported by the mana calamity. She is looking for Eris and Rudeus. She enters a berserk state, losing her reason and attacking indiscriminately. She asks Bigott if he has seen Eris or Rudeus. She learns that she is in Markien Mercenary Country and needs to head south to return to Asura. She intends to cut down anyone who gets in her way as she searches for Rudeus and Eris. She kills the Dikuto king. She slices off the head of the Emperor of Broze.",

She is currently the home tutor for the king’s son. She wrote a textbook on the Demon God tongue for Rudeus, including translations, pronunciation guides, and descriptions of demon races with personal commentary. Ghislaine thinks it is pathetic that she ran from her problems. She observes strange colors in the sky resembling uncontrolled summoning magic and wonders if Rudeus is involved. She is sexually harassed by Prince Pax Shirone and defends herself with magic. She has shortened her incantations over the past five years. Prince Pax Shirone attempts to blackmail her by threatening Rudeus, whom he believes is her lover, but she calls his bluff. She knows Prince Pax Shirone lacks the power to harm Rudeus, who is under the protection of the Boreas family.

            "brief_description": "A ten-year-old boy named Rudeus Greyrat, reincarnated from a 34-year-old unemployed virgin. He is working hard to live a proper life, studying magic and swordplay. He is currently in the City of Roa to work for the Young Mistress, and is revealed to be related to the Boreas Greyrat family. He is resourceful, using knowledge from his previous life to solve problems. He is currently Eris's tutor and is teaching her a variety of subjects. He is seeking a grimoire in the library and reflects on the history of magic textbooks. He organizes a staff meeting to discuss Eris's lesson schedule and proposes giving Eris a day off to reduce her stress. He assures Edna that her salary will remain the same despite the adjustment to the lesson schedule. He arranges monthly meetings with Edna and Ghislaine to address any issues regarding Eris's lessons. He plans to visit Roa on his first day off, but Eris and Ghislaine insist on accompanying him due to safety concerns. He reminds Ghislaine that Eris should only call for help within earshot. He compliments Eris's new outfit. He visits the mercantile district of Roa and takes notes on the prices of second-hand wares. He explains to Eris how to calculate profit from reselling. He explains the concept of reselling to the shop owner, who is not pleased. He emphasizes the importance of knowing prices. He is punched by Eris when she laughs at him. He visits a deserted bookstore in the outer part of Roa and takes notes on book titles and prices, recalling that Zenith gave him a similar book on his fifth birthday. He explains to Eris that he earns two silver pieces a month. He explains to Eris the concept of earning money before spending it. He notes down the name of a book he wants to buy. He sees a floating castle in the sky. He learns about Perugius from Eris and Ghislaine and researches him in a book, discovering his connection to the Dragon God Urupen and his role in the battle against Laplace. He learns about Perugius's twelve familiars and his role in sealing away the Demon God Laplace, leading to the start of the Armored Dragon Era. He reflects on Perugius's current status and expresses interest in visiting Chaos Breaker. He is pressured by Eris to take her out again. He acknowledges his lack of talent in swordplay. He observes that Eris and Ghislaine have hit an impasse in their magic lessons. He is unable to help them overcome their difficulties in casting different schools of magic. He decides to continue with basic magic lessons, hoping they will eventually be able to cast without chanting. He observes the bustle in the manor as Eris's tenth birthday approaches. He has free time due to Eris's etiquette lessons. He is attending Eris's birthday party as a house guest. He wants to explore the manor and find someone to help with the preparations. He considers the possibility of cake being served at the birthday party and heads towards the kitchen, hoping to find food samples. He witnesses Eris fleeing from Edna. He agrees to persuade Eris to return to her dance lessons to prevent her from shaming herself at her birthday party. He finds Eris behind the stables and attempts to persuade her to return to her dance lessons. He is kicked off the haystack by Eris. He tries to persuade Eris to give dance practice another chance, emphasizing the feeling of accomplishment from succeeding at something difficult. He accompanies Eris back to her dance lessons. He begins to learn to dance himself and quickly masters some beginner steps. He observes Eris's dancing struggles and attributes them to Edna's ineffective teaching methods and Eris's own fast, sharp movements. He instructs Eris to close her eyes and swing her body to her own rhythm. He uses a method similar to sword training to help Eris dance, clapping his hands in a rhythm for her to match as if dodging attacks. He explains to Edna and Eris that he used a similar approach to teaching Eris to dance as he does with arithmetic and swordplay. He discusses the origins of sword dancing with Edna, suggesting it may come from a desert country or even the Demon Continent. He hunkers down in a corner and observes from there during Eris's birthday party. He dances with Eris at her birthday party, adding feints into their routine. He is complimented by Edna on his performance. He sends food to Ghislaine. He dances with several girls at Eris's party. He learns that Sauros revealed his Greyrat lineage, leading nobles to send their daughters and granddaughters to dance with him. He is advised by Philip to engage with the women freely but is warned against emulating Paul's promiscuity. He dances with Eris to an unfamiliar song, incorporating swordplay-like movements. He is lifted onto Sauros's shoulders after the dance. He invites Ghislaine and Eris to his room after the party. He offers Eris and Ghislaine wine, ignoring the legal drinking age. He gives Eris and Ghislaine wands as birthday gifts. He tries to lighten the mood by presenting the Sylphie figurine to Eris. He stops Ghislaine from telling a story about Paul. He finds Eris sleeping next to him and decides not to disturb her. He explores the manor's tower and finds Sauros with a cat-eared maid. He is invited on a long ride by Sauros. He studies a book about the world's history and learns about the Ancient Age of the Gods and the Dragon God who destroyed the barriers between the worlds. He continues studying world history, learning about the Chaotic Period after the destruction of the barriers between worlds, the development of martial arts and magic, and the First and Second Great Human-Demon Wars. He learns about the Second Great Human-Demon War, the hero Aldebaran splitting the continent, and the subsequent isolation of demons on the Demon Continent. He learns about how the seven heroes convinced the beastfolk to join their side, leading to the sealing of Laplace and the destruction of his companions. He reflects on the significance of the number seven and the classification of various races. He learns about the various languages spoken in the world, named after the gods of the different races, except for the Human tongue. He also notes the regional dialects of the Human tongue and their associated stereotypes. He earns extra money through various side activities. He studies and learns the Beast God tongue with Ghislaine's help and attempts to learn the Demon God tongue. He receives a package from Roxy containing a letter and a thick, untitled book made of animal hide. He reflects on Ghislaine's high ranking in the Sword God Style and the fact that the Roxy figurine he made has found its way to its subject. He is determined to master the textbook on the Demon God tongue that Roxy wrote for him. He surprises Ghislaine with his actions and skills, proving to be more dependable than she initially thought. He patiently teaches Ghislaine arithmetic and magic, adapting his explanations to help her understand. He learns the Beast God tongue and expresses interest in cute girls with cat ears. He is studying the Demon God tongue. Ghislaine suspects he will become a womanizer like his father. He is more mature than Eris in reading, writing, arithmetic, magic, social skills, and conversational prowess. He has dedicated the last two years to language studies and has learned the Beast God, Demon God, and Fighting God tongues. He can speak four languages. He is approaching the Intermediate tier in swordplay. He is improving his magic by making figurines. He is looking forward to learning at the Magic University. He overhears Eris planning a surprise party for him. He is being hidden from the public eye due to his father's past and the paranoia of those in power. He reflects on the customs of nobility and anticipates Eris's disappointment if he doesn't react enthusiastically to her surprise party. He practices making fake tears with water magic. He is aware of Ghislaine's nervousness and desire to keep him in his room. He teases Ghislaine by suggesting they go demonstrate Saint-tier magic and presents her with a work-in-progress figurine of herself. He examines Ghislaine's muscular behind to get a better understanding of the base of her tail. He attends his surprise birthday party and acts surprised and grateful, even shedding fake tears to show his appreciation. His overly enthusiastic acting causes Eris, Philip, and Sauros to overreact. He embraces Eris and whispers words of gratitude in her ear. He guesses that his father is the surprise, but he is incorrect. He is embraced by Hilda. He is told he is part of the Greyrat family and is encouraged to marry Eris. He is presented with an expensive staff by Eris. He examines the staff, noting the affinity between wood and magic types, and the importance of the crystal's size, transparency, and color for amplifying magic. He is given the staff Aqua Heartia as a gift from Eris and the Greyrat family. He listens to Philip explain the Boreas family's tradition of taking sons to the imperial capital. He is told by Philip that Hilda hated him because her sons were taken away while Rudeus was allowed to stay. Philip expresses hope in Rudeus's abilities and suggests he could help overthrow James. He learns that Paul cried to Philip because he was going to get married but didn’t have the money to afford a place and needed a stable job. He is tempted by Eris's offer to do 'just a little' and decides to accept it, sitting next to her on the bed. He kisses Eris on the cheek, touches her breasts, and reaches for her thigh, misinterpreting her consent. He is slapped and kicked by Eris. He reflects on his actions, realizing he misread the situation and acted impulsively, driven by lust. He recognizes the potential consequences of his actions and fears becoming entangled in the Boreas family's power struggles. He decides to leave the Boreas household and die on the roadside. He apologizes to Eris for his actions. He is forgiven by Eris, who sets a five-year waiting period. He vows to be a gentleman until then, but accidentally 'releases the A button' the next morning. He asks the maid to keep quiet about his 'accident'. Roxy wonders if he is involved in the strange magical phenomenon she is observing. He is under the protection of the Boreas family. He prepares to demonstrate Saint-tier water magic to Ghislaine and Eris but is interrupted by the strange phenomenon in the sky. He tests his new staff, Aqua Heartia, and discovers it amplifies his magic significantly, especially water magic. He is attacked by a mysterious man wearing a yellow mask and is defended by Ghislaine. He recognizes Arumanfi as one of Perugius's twelve familiars and warns Ghislaine about his ability to move at the speed of light. He retreats with Eris to a safe distance. He is thought to be the cause of the strange phenomenon in the sky by Arumanfi. He attempts to speak with Arumanfi when a beam of light from the sky engulfs the Fittoa Region. He shields Eris as the region vanishes. Roxy hopes that he used his quick wits to survive. His name is listed in the missing persons column. He is adaptable and resourceful.",

He could not attend Rudeus's party because monsters have become more active in the forest. He cried to Philip because he was going to get married but didn’t have the money to afford a place and needed a stable job. He is alive and searching for his missing family, including Rudeus, Zenith, Lilia, and Aisha. He is currently headed to the Millis Continent, Zenith's birthplace. He is asking for help from his former adventuring party, the Fang of the Black Wolf, and is willing to do anything to find his family. He is considered reliable in crisis situations.",

            "brief_description": "Philip Boreas Greyrat's daughter and Rudeus's student. She is arrogant, fierce, proud, has a fiery temper, is physically violent, prone to vengeful behavior, and does not listen to others. She is skilled at rendering her opponents powerless. She is currently being tutored by Rudeus in a variety of subjects. She is motivated to improve and aims to be as good as Ghislaine and Rudeus. She is becoming violent again due to the lack of breaks in her schedule. She is irritable during arithmetic lessons. She is being taught to perform mental arithmetic by Rudeus. She insists on accompanying Rudeus to Roa, believing she can escape kidnapping on her own. She is curious about Rudeus's plans for his day off. She wears a new outfit and punches Rudeus when he compliments her. She struggles with calculating profit during reselling but eventually grasps the concept, albeit with errors. She doesn't understand the usefulness of knowing the prices of things. She laughs at Rudeus when Rudeus suggests that knowing prices is useless. She offers to buy Rudeus a book but is reminded that she has no money. She is lectured by Rudeus on the importance of earning money before spending it. She briefly understands the lecture and shows a rare look of utter defeat. She proudly explains Perugius's history as one of the three legendary heroes who defeated the Demon God Laplace. She demands to be taken out again, displaying a mix of emotions. She is becoming more perceptive of Rudeus's teaching methods. She is adept at reading and writing, but struggles with arithmetic. She has mastered most basic magic spells except earth. She has reached Intermediate-tier in Sword God Style and is approaching her tenth birthday, which is being celebrated with a large party. She is taking special etiquette lessons to avoid shaming herself at her birthday party. She is currently fleeing from Edna because she struggles with dancing lessons. She is at risk of shaming herself at her birthday party. She is lying on a pile of hay behind the stables. She kicks Rudeus off the haystack and rests her heel on his head. She expresses her dislike for dancing and declares that she won't dance at her birthday either. She is eventually motivated to return to her dance lessons and asks Rudeus to accompany her. She sulks when Edna compliments Rudeus. Her personality and movements are well suited to the Sword God Style, but they are a drawback when it comes to dancing. Her steps are too fast and too sharp. Her rhythm and instinctively dislikes being interrupted. She is doubtful when Rudeus asks her to close her eyes and swing her body to her own rhythm. She is able to dance to the rhythm when Rudeus claps his hands to mimic dodging attacks. She nods and remains silent with her eyes wide open when Rudeus explains that he used a similar approach to teaching her to dance as he does with arithmetic and swordplay. She proudly praises Rudeus. She is dolled up and seated like a princess at her birthday party. She turns into a robot that parrots the words, \"Please tell my father,\" whenever anything is brought up. She dances with Rudeus at her birthday party and steps on his foot a few times. She approaches Rudeus for a dance, wearing a blue dress. She is wearing an up-do with a floral ornament and looks lovely. She seems excited and is the star of her birthday party. She dances with Rudeus to an unfamiliar song, incorporating swordplay-like movements. She is laughing like a girl her age should. She is excited and nervous during her party. She drinks wine with Rudeus and Ghislaine, ignoring the legal drinking age. She prefers Rudeus's miniature replicas to the wand he gives her. She is happy to receive a talisman ring from Ghislaine. She sleeps next to Rudeus, hugging the wand and wearing the talisman ring. She is better behaved after her tenth birthday, takes her lessons seriously, and punches Rudeus less frequently. She is the imagined version of the Great Emperor of the Demon World, Kishirika, in Rudeus's mind. She helped save Ghislaine from starvation. She is developing feelings for Rudeus. She has grown a lot in the past two years and has stopped yelling and sullying her clothes. She wants to look good in front of Rudeus. She stayed the night in Rudeus's room. She is devoting herself to sword practice, possibly feeling pressure from Rudeus's maturity and skills. She asks Ghislaine to accompany her in sword practice. She is improving her writing skills and is able to imitate ladylike manners. She is now at Advanced-tier in swordplay. She is planning a surprise party for Rudeus's tenth birthday. She went to her grandfather for the first time in a long while to request a secret party for Rudeus. She wears a bright red dress and has a large bouquet of flowers in her arms at Rudeus's surprise birthday party. She is gobsmacked by Rudeus's acting. She presents Rudeus with an expensive staff as a gift and looks to her father for backup. She reveals that Paul and Zenith couldn't come to the party. She is surprised when her mother suggests that Rudeus marry her. She is told to refine herself as a lady. She asks Alphonse to explain the staff's origins to Rudeus. She presents Rudeus with the Aqua Heartia staff. She becomes exhausted and falls asleep, and Ghislaine carries her to her room. She is wearing a red negligee and claims she came to sleep with Rudeus because he might be lonely. She offers Rudeus to do 'just a little'. She allows Rudeus to kiss her cheek and touch her breasts, but shoves him away and slaps him when he reaches for her thigh. She attacks Rudeus after he misinterprets her offer, leaving the door open as she storms out. She peeks in on Rudeus and forgives him, but sets a five-year waiting period for anything more. She is sometimes violent, sometimes meek, depending on the situation. She listens properly. She is almost perfect in reading and writing. She is capable of doing division. She can't do any spells without chanting them, and Intermediate-tier spells are also a challenge. She is studying difficult imperial court etiquette. She loves Rudeus. She was an uncontainable wild animal three years ago, but has recently become more refined. She is nervous and excited when Rudeus prepares to demonstrate his magic. She notices the mana in the sky. She retreats with Rudeus to a safe distance. She freezes in confusion as a beam of light engulfs the Fittoa Region. Rudeus wraps his body around her to shield her as the region vanishes. Her name is listed in the missing persons column.",

He and his wife deftly handle the poorer and lesser nobles that swarm around the family at Eris's birthday party. He explains that Sauros revealed Rudeus's Greyrat lineage. He advises Rudeus to engage with the women freely but warns him against emulating Paul's promiscuity. He attempts to restrain Sauros from starting a war against the Notos family. He escorts Hilda away from the scene with glacial composure. He watches over the party with a smile. He reveals to Rudeus that Eris has older and younger brothers who were taken by his elder brother as adopted sons according to the Boreas family tradition. He lost the battle to become the head of the family to James, and still hopes to overthrow him. He recognizes Rudeus's acting and abilities. He admits he hired Ghislaine to teach Eris swordplay because he thought she was hopeless as a noble. He offers Rudeus the opportunity to marry Eris and help him seize control of the Boreas family. He claims he has no responsibility for Eris and would prefer to hand her over to Rudeus.",

He saved Ghislaine from starvation after she was defrauded. He threatens war against the Notos family to install Rudeus as the head of the family.

      PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
      I mean, what are you planning to do?” “Anyone who gets in my way gets cut down. That’s all.” There was a ferocity in her eyes that made him doubt if she was still in possession of reason. Bigott had no words. Just what had her so stirred up? “Hopefully Rudeus is with Lady Eris, but there’s a chance they were both transported somewhere else just like I was. I have to hurry.” After hearing that, he understood. We’re not that different, he thought. Those two children, particularly the red-haired girl, were 234 | P a g e more important than anything to the Sword King. She was desperate to protect that which was precious to her. “In that case, why don’t we travel part of the way together? We also have something to take care of in that direction.” “Very well.” For some reason Bigott felt particularly proud. Although their objectives differed, he felt like he was standing side-by-side with this Sword King, fighting for something he wanted to protect. Bigott, his men, and Ghislaine slipped out from the forest and attacked the Dikuto Kingdom from behind. Their luck was good. As soon as the battle with Markien began, all the troops were focused on what was in front of them. The Broze Emperor found it suspicious that his bodyguards had failed to return. He suspected the Dikuto Kingdom was planning an ambush for his troops, and that his bodyguards had been killed after discovering their plot. After all, the Dikuto king’s main army was close to the forest. It seemed likely they had troops hiding further within. In truth, the Dikuto king was a coward and had camped with his back to the forest so he wouldn’t be caught in a surprise attack by the Broze Empire. The combination of these factors would later lead to Bigott’s success. Ghislaine howled and Bigott let out a fierce cry as he led his men into battle. They charged right into the enemy camp where the Dikuto king’s tent was set up. The king was startled by their surprise attack. Seeing their armor, he immediately thought the Broze Emperor had launched a sneak attack from the forest. He hailed a nearby attendant and commanded an assault on the Broze Empire. Then he tried to take shelter from the chaos.
235 | P a g e It was only ten seconds later when Ghislaine tore the Dikuto king asunder with her blade, killing him. If he had lived, he might have realized Bigott and his men were not of the Broze Empire and retracted his orders, but an imperial edict had absolute power. The Dikuto Kingdom surged into battle against the Broze Empire. The Broze Empire had predicted such an attack would come, so while they were caught off guard by its timing, they were able to put up a fight. That was when the Markien Mercenary Country took up arms. It was a three-pronged free-for-all. Bigott found himself surrounded by enemies, but he was still alive. It was his mission to die deceiving the Dikuto Kingdom into thinking his attack was the work of the Broze Empire, yet still he clung to life. He and his men had already been separated, and the only ally close to him was a single fighter. There, right in front of him. He followed in the shadow of her tanned back as the light of her sword flashed, cutting through the enemy. He had never seen such a reliable figure before. He felt so proud to be protecting her flank. At last they could no longer see the armor of the Dikuto Kingdom around them. Instead, they were surrounded by soldiers of the Broze Empire. While the Empire was surprised by the intrusion of a woman with a blood-red blade, they had watched her cut down the Dikuto Kingdom’s men and noticed Bigott protecting her flank in his Broze armor. They mistook Bigott and Ghislaine for allies. That was when Markien surged in. The two allied countries were shaken as the battle started up behind them. Not only had their bond alliance broken, but their formations as well. Markien, which should have been at a disadvantage, broke through their front lines. A chaotic battle ensued. Amidst the violent fighting, Bigott became separated from Ghislaine, but managed to rejoin his comrades. Shouts of joy rang out from the Markien mercenaries as 236 | P a g e they recognized Bigott and took up a firm position around him. Instead of falling back, Bigott remained on the front lines and kept fighting. The battle raged on, the soldiers covered in mud and blood, not fully aware of what was happening around them.
Bigott took an arrow in his left eye. Anguished, he searched for the bowman responsible. That was when he saw it. He watched as it happened. Below an eye-catching banner, dressed in luxurious Broze armor, was a man with a black beard. Bigott saw the flash of red as that man, the Emperor of Broze, had his head sliced off by a brown-skinned woman. “Ha, hah, hahaha!” He laughed, and as he laughed, the battle wore on. And he lived. The final battle ended in victory for the Markien Mercenary Country. *** Thanks to his achievements, Bigott Mercenal earned the position of general. He was celebrated as a legendary hero for having succeeded in a suicide mission and for executing Dikuto’s king. After that, Bigott Mercenal continued to do spectacular work that resulted in him being known as one of the most outstanding Great Generals of the Markien Mercenary Country. That, however, is a story for another time. Once that decisive battle was over, the Great General Bigott started doing something strange. He started wearing a necklace that had the profile of a female beastfolk chiseled into it, and began painting the blade of his sword red. “It’s a good luck charm.” 237 | P a g e His men began to imitate him, and those who heard their tales followed suit. These customs continued spreading until they took their modern-day shape. When asked what kind of good luck charm it was, Bigott responded thus: “I was helped by a goddess during that battle. I’m following her example.” It was from his words that the Forest Goddess Laine was created. The name Ghislaine was difficult for those in the southern part of the Central Continent to pronounce, and so her name, altered by their accents, became Laine. She appeared from the forest, rescuing the life of the great general, becoming the Goddess of Salvation. Forest Goddess Laine. For the next hundred years she was worshipped as Markien’s Goddess of Protection, providing support to the hearts of many soldiers. Of course, the real Ghislaine had no knowledge of this designation. Where did Ghislaine go after that? Was she still alive? Did she survive that battle and go on home to Asura Kingdom? Was she able to meet that precious Young Mistress of hers again? Bigott Mercenal had no way of knowing.
