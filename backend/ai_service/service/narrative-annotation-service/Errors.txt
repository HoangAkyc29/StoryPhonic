            "brief_description": "A high school student who lives alone in a spacious apartment due to his parents' wealth. He considers his next-door neighbor, Mahiru Shiina, to be beautiful, like an angel. He is aware of her popularity and intends to keep his distance to avoid trouble, appreciating her from afar. He is observant, shows concern for Mahiru, and impulsively offered her his umbrella. He catches a cold after being in the rain and is bad at taking care of himself, with a messy apartment and a poor diet. He attempts to downplay his sickness to Mahiru and is embarrassed by the state of his apartment. He is now being cared for by Mahiru, who is concerned about his well-being. He is grateful for Mahiru's care, though he believes she is only helping him out of guilt. He is still recovering from his fever. He is curious about why Mahiru was in the rain and assumes she had a fight with her boyfriend. He realizes he has stepped on a social land mine when he brings up Mahiru having boyfriends and apologizes. He assures Mahiru he wasn't trying to take advantage of her kindness and won't bother her again without a good reason. He reflects on the secret of being nursed back to health by Mahiru, though he finds it a pain to explain. He believes they will return to being mere acquaintances, which is what happens. He is urged by Itsuki to clean his room. He dismisses any possibility of a romantic relationship with Mahiru. He is questioned by Mahiru about his dinner choice of nutritional jelly, expressing concern for his diet. He is aware of his poor living habits and is scolded by Mahiru.

He is now receiving home-cooked meals from Mahiru on a regular basis. He is aware that Mahiru is helping him out of pity. He sarcastically calls Mahiru \"Mom\" after she tells him to eat proper meals and get his life together. He enjoys Mahiru's cooking and returns the container to her the next evening. He is wary of being seen with Mahiru, fearing social repercussions, but is grateful for the food. He buys a bottle of soy sauce for Mahiru at the supermarket. He is aware that Mahiru's feelings toward him are not romantic. He starts fixing microwave packets of rice with each meal because Mahiru's cooking always makes him want rice. He has developed an appetite like never before thanks to Mahiru's cooking and relies on her charity. He acknowledges that Mahiru's care has improved his lifestyle. He feels that Mahiru is meddling in his life, but appreciates her care. He is pale, gangly, and apathetic, resembling a zombie, according to Itsuki. He is unaware of how others perceive him and is surprised to hear that he looks like a corpse. He is supported by his wealthy parents and tries not to waste money. He carries Mahiru's heavy grocery bag and takes the lead, leaving her behind in the supermarket. He is terrible at cleaning, but surprisingly capable of cooking simple meals, albeit with potential for injury. He is also capable of doing laundry. He is at a complete loss on how to start cleaning his apartment. He is ashamed of his messy apartment and feels like Mahiru is a savior. He is aware of his poor living habits and expects Mahiru to give him cleaning tips. He acknowledges his terrible habits and the consequences of not cleaning regularly. He is now being instructed by Mahiru on how to clean his apartment. He is now being directed by Mahiru to sort and discard magazines and clutter.

He is surprised to learn that Mahiru has never ordered pizza. He orders pizza with Mahiru and observes her enjoying it.

He is now receiving frequent reminders and tips on cleaning from Mahiru, and his apartment remains as nice as it had been when he and Mahiru had finished tidying up the place. He is annoyed by having to witness Itsuki and Chi's flirting. He reveals that his mother is clingy and often checks up on him, which makes him uncomfortable.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student who excels in academics and sports. She is Amane's next-door neighbor and is admired by many. She is reserved and guarded and was found sitting alone in the rain. She is aware of Amane's existence but maintains a guarded distance. She feels responsible for Amane catching a cold and insists on helping him, even entering his messy apartment. She is now actively taking care of Amane, showing concern for his well-being. She is a capable caregiver, providing medicine, cooling sheets, and homemade rice porridge. She is easily flustered and shy around Amane. She is concerned about Amane's health and urges him to rest. She is a good cook and prepares essentials for Amane, such as sports drinks and cooling sheets. She is relieved when Amane enjoys her cooking. She denies having or wanting a boyfriend, which surprises Amane. She is not the kind of girl who would keep the company of several boys at once. She was in the rain to cool her head. She admits she gets annoyed by unwanted attention from guys, revealing a more human side to her. She dislikes being called an \"angel\". She gives Amane a quick bow when they encounter each other. She is seen surrounded by her classmates, smiling and interacting with them. She questions Amane's dinner choice of nutritional jelly, expressing concern for his diet. She brings Amane leftovers, expressing concern for his health and well-being. She criticizes Amane's eating habits and messy room, expressing concern for his well-being. She says she brought leftovers to Amane out of concern for his health and not out of obligation. She tells Amane to eat proper meals and get his life together. She is health-conscious and a skilled cook, making her own dashi stock. She gives Amane another container of food (saut√©ed pork and eggplant), claiming she made too much. She encounters Amane at the supermarket and buys ingredients for dinner. She asks Amane to buy a bottle of soy sauce for her because she is only allowed to buy one at the bargain price. She states that people might get the wrong idea since people usually do this sort of thing for someone they like, but clarifies her feelings toward Amane are not romantic. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices when she can. She is frugal and environmentally conscious. She reflects on the difference between her public persona and her direct manner with Amane. She is one of the people lecturing Amane about cleaning his apartment. She is critical of Amane's messy apartment and offers to help him clean it, expressing her dismay at its filth and his lack of self-care. She emphasizes the importance of routine cleaning. She returns to Amane's apartment wearing comfortable cleaning clothes. She is now directing Amane to clean his apartment thoroughly, starting with the clothes on the floor. She is now directing Amane to sort and discard magazines and clutter, emphasizing efficiency due to time constraints. She slips on a piece of discarded clothing, but Amane catches her. She is unfazed by their close contact. She spent the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and is tired but feels a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant, as her family's help always made the meals. She is from a wealthy family. She orders pizza with Amane and enjoys it with delicate bites. She tells Amane not to stare at her. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was a child. She tells Amane that he makes her stomach turn in knots. She has been scolding Amane, telling him that he has to keep his apartment tidy. Her words make it clear that she actually does care about him, at least a bit. She brings Amane oden, a type of stew, and is glad that Amane can now invite friends over thanks to their cleaning efforts. She shares her meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she likes treating people. She also appreciates his honest feedback on her cooking and was concerned about his eating habits. She is seen sitting on a bench in the park with a stiff posture. She is being careful not to let something show on her face. She looks like she is lost and doesn't know what to do. She sprained her ankle while rescuing a cat from a tree.

      PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
      ‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for her to give it to me for free, though.‚Äù He opened the door back into his own place. ‚ÄúWho was it?‚Äù Itsuki asked. ‚ÄúMy neighbor. She gave me some of her dinner. I‚Äôm gonna put it in the fridge, so don‚Äôt restart the game without me,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúAh, sorry, I already beat the boss.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou gotta be kidding me.‚Äù Every day on his way home, Amane passed the park where he and Mahiru had properly met for the first time. The building where Amane lived was less of a family-use apartment complex and more aimed at single people and couples, so there were few children around, and the surrounding apartment buildings were much the same. Tucked away and out of sight, the little park close to Amane‚Äôs building was often deserted. It was in that little park devoid of children, Amane saw Mahiru for the second time. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing in a place like this?‚Äù he asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Nothing.‚Äù Mahiru was sitting on a bench with straight posture and didn‚Äôt budge at all even after she recognized Amane and looked him over. In contrast to the first time the two had met there, this time they were already acquainted and were on speaking terms. That had made it easier for Amane to call to Mahiru, but the girl‚Äôs voice had still been stiff when she answered. It didn‚Äôt seem like Mahiru was on guard, as she had been during their first encounter. This was something different. Amane could tell that Mahiru was being careful not to let something show on her face. ‚ÄúCome on, if it was nothing, you wouldn‚Äôt be sitting here making that face. Did something happen?‚Äù Amane inquired. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Not really‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru looked, as she had before when she was on the swing in the rainstorm, like she was lost and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Seeing her like that worried Amane, but Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem keen to speak on the matter. Though he was bound by their tacit promise not to interact outside their apartments, Amane hadn‚Äôt been able to help calling out to Mahiru when he‚Äôd seen her all alone in the park again. Mahiru, for her part, probably did not much want to talk to him; her expression was stiff and blank.
Amane thought it was fine if the girl wasn‚Äôt feeling up to talking, when he noticed that there were a number of white hairs stuck to her blazer. ‚ÄúYou have some hair stuck to your uniform; were you playing with a dog or a cat?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt playing. I just helped a cat that was stranded up a tree get back down,‚Äù Mahiru explained. ‚ÄúWhat a total clich√©‚Ä¶ Ah, I get it now.‚Äù ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚ÄúWait right there. Don‚Äôt you dare move.‚Äù Amane had finally realized just why Mahiru was sitting there alone on the bench. He sighed and dashed off. He was certain that Mahiru would do as he had asked and would not go anywhere. Actually, it would have been more appropriate to say that she couldn‚Äôt go anywhere. Muttering to himself about how Mahiru chose the strangest times to act tough, Amane bought a compress and medical tape from the neighborhood drugstore, along with a cup of ice normally used for iced coffee from a convenience store. When Amane at last returned to the park, he found Mahiru sitting on the bench, just as he‚Äôd expected. She hadn‚Äôt so much as shifted. ‚ÄúShiina, take off your tights.‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù He gave a direct order, and she answered in an extremely cold voice. ‚ÄúYeah, I know it‚Äôs kind of sudden‚Ä¶ Look, I‚Äôll put my blazer over you and turn around, so take the tights off. We need to ice the injury and put a compress on it.‚Äù As expected, Mahiru was none too happy at being ordered to take off her tights, so by way of explanation, Amane waved the bag full of medical supplies. Mahiru‚Äôs face understandably tightened. ‚Äú‚Ä¶How did you know?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou had one of your loafers off, and that ankle seemed slightly swollen. Plus, you didn‚Äôt try to stand up. It really is a total clich√© to sprain your ankle while rescuing a cat.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, be quiet.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, yeah. Now, take off your tights and give me your foot.‚Äù It was something anyone would have known just from looking, but Mahiru was making a sour face, perhaps because she hadn‚Äôt expected him to notice that she was hurt. Obediently, Mahiru accepted Amane‚Äôs blazer and put it over her knees, so it seemed like she was going to listen to what he was saying.
Amane turned his back to Mahiru, put the ice from the cup he had bought at the convenience store into a plastic bag, and poured water over it. After he tied the top shut so it wouldn‚Äôt spill out, he wrapped it loosely in a hand towel that he kept in his backpack, making an impromptu ice pack. Then he turned around slowly. Mahiru had done as he had asked and removed her tights, exposing her bare legs. They were slender and smooth‚Äîand looked soft even as she tensed up. The unnatural swelling around her ankle was evident. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not that badly swollen, but it could get worse if you move it too much. First of all, this is going to be cold, but let‚Äôs ice it for a bit. Once the pain goes away a little, I‚Äôll put a compress on, so take it easy,‚Äù Amane explained. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you.‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom now on, just ask for my help. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll owe me or anything.‚Äù If anything, it‚Äôs the opposite‚ÄîI want to pay you back in some small way for everything you‚Äôve done for me, so I‚Äôd appreciate if you would let me solve one or two problems for you. Mahiru sported her usual expression. Still, she didn‚Äôt argue with Amane and quietly let him ice her ankle while her leg was propped up on the bench. ‚ÄúHas the pain gotten any better?‚Äù Amane asked after a moment. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Yeah, a bit,‚Äù Mahiru replied. ‚ÄúAll right, I‚Äôm putting the compress on, so‚Ä¶don‚Äôt get mad at me for being a perv or a groper or something, okay?‚Äù ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say something so rude to the person helping me.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood to hear.‚Äù Stressing that he had absolutely no untoward thoughts, Amane squatted down next to Mahiru‚Äôs leg and stuck a compress on her swollen, red ankle. When Amane initially asked about the level of pain, it sounded like the sort of thing where Mahiru could still stand and walk, but moving risked agitating the sprain further, so she was better off sitting here quietly. As long as she stayed off it, it would probably remain a minor injury. Amane had just finished sticking on the compress and was securing it with medical tape when he noticed Mahiru staring intently down at him. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre surprisingly skillful with that,‚Äù she commented. ‚ÄúWell, I can do first aid.

      FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
      He knew that Mahiru had been poking fun when she‚Äôd brought up his strength, so he smiled, glad she was feeling well enough to crack jokes like that. ‚ÄúLook, if you‚Äôre game, put the hood up and wear my backpack. After you get on my back, take your own bag, too, while you‚Äôre at it. I won‚Äôt be able to hold it if I‚Äôm supporting you,‚Äù Amane instructed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Sorry,‚Äù Mahiru muttered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you: It‚Äôs fine. It wouldn‚Äôt be very manly of me to leave an injured person behind and go home‚Äîor to make you walk.‚Äù Amane crouched down and turned away from her, and Mahiru timidly leaned onto Amane‚Äôs back. Mahiru was wearing Amane‚Äôs parka, so she had on even more clothes than normal, but even so, he could feel her body pressed against him, slim and willowy. After confirming that Mahiru‚Äôs arms were secured around his neck without choking him, Amane stood up slowly, carrying the injured girl on his back. I knew it; she‚Äôs so light, Amane thought. He wondered if he should be the one worrying about her diet instead of the other way around. It was more likely that she was just naturally petite, though; that was probably all it was. Mahiru smelled slightly sweet, and though Amane could tell all sorts of things about how anxious she was feeling based on how tightly she clung to him, he headed for home without showing it. A few people did stare at the sight of a guy carrying someone on his back, but Mahiru had completely covered her face with the hood of his parka, so Amane wasn‚Äôt too worried about what little attention was being paid to them. ‚ÄúAll right, here we are.‚Äù Amane carried Mahiru as far as her front door, then let her down and quickly turned to leave without interfering any further. Since Mahiru could get around on her own while leaning on a wall, Amane guessed that her injury was probably not all that serious. Thankfully, it was Friday, so Mahiru had plenty of time to rest her ankle and get back on her feet with no problems. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need dinner tonight, so you should rest. If you like, I could bring you some nutritional supplements,‚Äù Amane offered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. I have some stuff prepared,‚Äù Mahiru answered. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs good.
See ya.‚Äù That was the most important thing: that food wouldn‚Äôt be a problem. It was essential that Mahiru be able to keep still and rest. Amane watched her open the lock on her front door, and he, too, took out his apartment key. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um,‚Äù started Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù When Amane heard the girl‚Äôs voice and turned around, he saw that she was looking up at him timidly, clutching her bag to her chest. She looked somewhat troubled, but as he tilted his head in confusion, she seemed to regain her resolve and looked straight into his eyes. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you for what you did today. You really saved me,‚Äù Mahiru admitted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, really. I just did it because I wanted to. Take care.‚Äù Embarrassed by the notion of Mahiru fretting over his help, Amane quickly dismissed the thought from his mind. After Mahiru gave him a quick nod, Amane turned to unlock his own door. It was only then that Amane realized that Mahiru was still wearing his parka and athletic pants, but he was sure she would return them another day, so he slipped into his apartment without saying anything. ‚ÄúDamn, dude, you so healthy that you wear shorts year-round now?‚Äù Amane‚Äôs melancholy in Monday‚Äôs gym class had less to do with his lack of athletic talent and more to do with the fact that he was wearing knee-length jersey shorts during an unpleasantly cold season. Everyone else had already switched to their winter gym uniforms, but Amane stood out from all the rest, his legs bare below the knee. ‚ÄúAs if. I just forgot my pants.‚Äù ‚ÄúIdiot.‚Äù ‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù Amane hadn‚Äôt seen Mahiru over the weekend, and she still had his gym pants, but he couldn‚Äôt tell Itsuki that, so there was nothing to do but say that he forgot. He had resigned himself to the inevitable mockery, though when Itsuki slapped his back, cackling with laughter, Amane still found it in himself to slap him back. Amane let out a soft sigh as he watched Itsuki groan quietly. Then his gaze shifted. At the moment, the boys were practicing their high jumps, and the girls were using the other side of the field. What‚Äôs more, since two classes of students were using the field at once, it was fairly crowded.
The girls were practicing different track-and-field events, so between taking turns, the girls had plenty of time to watch Amane‚Äôs class. ‚ÄúDo your best, Kadowaki!‚Äù Usually, the boys and girls took gym class in different places on campus; with the girls present, the boys were getting all worked up. The girls, on the other hand, all spent their time watching Amane‚Äôs most popular classmate, the handsome Yuuta Kadowaki. Amane had never really talked to him before, but he was nice to everyone and was a great student, and on top of that, he was the ace of the track club despite being only a first-year. Everyone knew he was popular with the girls. Amane figured Yuuta must have won some kind of karmic lottery. A lot of the other boys didn‚Äôt care for him as much, and there were always a lot of sulky looks when he was around. ‚ÄúOh wow, looks like Yuuta‚Äôs as popular as always,‚Äù Itsuki observed. ‚ÄúLooks that way,‚Äù Amane answered dully. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt seem too interested,‚Äù Itsuki prodded. ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre friends or anything; we‚Äôve barely ever spoken. So why should I care?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt as though Yuuta was mean or ever messed with Amane. They had nothing to do with each other, so Amane honestly did not care. He knew that he was in the minority there, but he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to envy Yuuta the same way all the other boys did. More specifically, Amane knew that Yuuta was so far out of his league that envying him was pointless. ‚ÄúTypical Amane. What, you don‚Äôt get jealous now?‚Äù Itsuki asked. ‚ÄúOh, should I be like ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm sooo jealous of his populaaarity,‚Äô huh?‚Äù Amane mocked. ‚ÄúThat was pretty good.‚Äù Itsuki guffawed. Amane looked over at Yuuta, who was wearing a brilliant smile and basking in feminine adoration. Even Amane had to admit that Yuuta‚Äôs athletic body and handsome face made him look just like a prince. In fact, some girls had taken to calling him that. Yuuta rewarded the girls‚Äô passionate gazes and shrill voices with another radiant smile and waved back at them. He really knew how to cultivate a following. ‚ÄúWell, he sure is popular, no arguing with that,‚Äù admitted Itsuki. ‚ÄúI know. The other guys can‚Äôt contain their jealousy,‚Äù Amane said. ‚ÄúHa-ha. But the girls are real energetic, too.‚Äù Itsuki only had eyes for his girlfriend, Chitose.

      MAIN TEXT EXCERPT:
      Still can‚Äôt cook, though.‚Äù Amane shrugged, acting a little silly, and Mahiru let out a small laugh. He was glad to see her taut expression relax some, even if it was only a tiny bit. Reassured by Mahiru‚Äôs slightly softened attitude, Amane pulled the pants of his gym uniform from his backpack. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, handing them to Mahiru. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make that face at me; I don‚Äôt like it. Anyway, your legs are exposed, right? And it‚Äôs not like you can put your tights back on with the compress stuck to you. Relax, I haven‚Äôt worn them.‚Äù It would be bad to let her put her tights back on over her swollen ankle, especially now that it had medical tape wrapped around it. Since it looked so painful, Amane figured Mahiru could wear his gym pants, both as protection from the cold and to stop anyone from seeing her underwear. Mahiru seemed to understand that he was just trying to be considerate, and so she slipped the pants on. Amane snatched up his blazer and handed Mahiru the parka he‚Äôd been wearing. ‚ÄúHere, wear this,‚Äù he told her. ‚ÄúWait, but why?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you want to be seen being carried?‚Äù Letting Mahiru walk on her ankle was a bad idea. Amane had been planning to bring her home from the start. They were both headed to the same place, after all. ‚ÄúOh, sorry, but could you put my backpack on?‚Äù Amane asked. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt carry you on my back if I‚Äôm wearing it, obviously.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there an option where you don‚Äôt carry me?‚Äù ‚ÄúLook here, your ankle is twisted, so you need to rest it. No one‚Äôs around, and I‚Äôve got perfectly good legs, so please put them to use.‚Äù ‚ÄúYour legs?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat, you‚Äôd prefer my arms? Would you rather I support you from the side?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you even strong enough to carry me all that way?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you making fun of me? ‚Ä¶Well, I‚Äôm actually not that confident.‚Äù Amane knew he could support Mahiru if she leaned on him, but honestly, it would be quite difficult to fully carry her all the way back to the apartment complex. What‚Äôs more, it would be sure to attract a lot of attention, which Amane preferred to avoid.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm.

It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning.

It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation.

After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed.

He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed.

Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit.

It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        That much was obvious the moment I saw your place. That‚Äôs why you got sick, dumbass.‚Äù Amane couldn‚Äôt really argue with Itsuki‚Äôs friendly ribbing. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have the most wholesome lifestyle. To elaborate, he was bad at keeping things tidy, and his room was always a total mess. What‚Äôs more, he subsisted on a diet of convenience-store meals and nutritional supplements. The only time he had a decent meal was when he went out to eat once in a blue moon. Itsuki often grew frustrated with him, asking him how he could live like that. Knowing his friend kept such habits, Itsuki was not at all surprised that Amane had caught a cold overnight. ‚ÄúYou oughtta go straight home today and rest up. Tomorrow‚Äôs Saturday, so focus on getting better,‚Äù Itsuki advised. ‚ÄúI will‚Ä¶,‚Äù Amane replied. ‚ÄúIf only you had a nice girl to nurse you back to health like I do.‚Äù Itsuki‚Äôs lips curled up at his slight boast. ‚ÄúShut up. I don‚Äôt need to hear that from a guy who‚Äôs already got a girlfriend.‚Äù Amane slapped away the box of tissues in front of him with the back of his hand, intensely irritated. As the day wore on, Amane‚Äôs condition continued to deteriorate. The headache and runny nose were soon accompanied by throat pain and a fatigue that permeated his body. Though he single-mindedly hurried home after school, his body seemed to be losing its battle against the disease, and his pace was agonizingly slow. Eventually, he reached the lobby of his apartment building and forced his heavy legs to move him into the elevator, where he leaned against the wall. His breathing was rougher than usual, and he felt hot. Somehow, Amane had been able to endure it while he was at school, but he‚Äôd let his guard down now that home was in sight, and his condition had suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Even the peculiar floating sensation of riding in the elevator, normally not a concern, was now a source of dull agony. When the elevator eventually stopped on Amane‚Äôs floor, he staggered out on leaden feet and began to shuffle toward his apartment. Almost immediately, he was confronted by a sight that caused him to seize up, however.
Right there in front of him was the girl he had not expected to speak to again, her shimmery flaxen hair fluttering in the breeze. Her lovely features were full of life, her complexion vibrant and glowing. Even though she had definitely seemed the more likely candidate to catch a cold, she was healthy as could be. The benefits of her self-care were on vivid display. In her hands, Mahiru was gripping the umbrella that Amane had forced on her the day before, neatly folded and closed. She must have come to return it, even though I told her she didn‚Äôt have to, Amane reasoned. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Really, you don‚Äôt need to give it back,‚Äù he said aloud. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only natural to return something you borrowed‚Ä¶‚Äù Mahiru hesitated as soon as she got a good look at Amane‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúUm. You have a fever, don‚Äôt you‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶It‚Äôs got nothing to do with you.‚Äù Amane frowned. This was perhaps the worst possible time to run into Mahiru ‚Äîand all over a stupid umbrella, too. It was the kind of thing that shouldn‚Äôt have been worth the trouble of returning. Mahiru was smart, however, and was sure to quickly figure out how Amane had caught a cold. ‚ÄúBut you only became sick because you loaned me your umbrella‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs totally unrelated. Besides, I loaned it to you on a whim.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt most certainly is related! The fact is that you caught a cold because I was out there in the rain.‚Äù ‚ÄúI said it‚Äôs fine, really. It‚Äôs not something you need to worry about.‚Äù From Amane‚Äôs perspective, he had done her the favor for his own self- satisfaction, and he didn‚Äôt want her fussing over him now. However, Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem likely to just leave him be. Anxiety was written across her graceful features. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So yeah, it‚Äôs all good. See ya.‚Äù Their back-and-forth was quickly growing taxing, so Amane decided to force his way out from under Mahiru‚Äôs questioning and concern. Swaying and staggering, he snatched the umbrella from her and pulled his keys out of his pocket. Everything was going fine, so far. Unfortunately, Amane fumbled quite a bit as he opened the door to his apartment. The moment he got it open, all the strength left his body.
Perhaps the feeling of relief on finally entering his home was to blame for how his body unexpectedly keeled over toward the railing behind him. Although Amane was alarmed, he trusted that the railing was solid enough that it wouldn‚Äôt break, and he wouldn‚Äôt fall. Surely it would catch him, and he‚Äôd be fine. The impact will probably hurt a bit, but I guess there‚Äôs no avoiding it‚Ä¶, Amane thought, resigning himself to the pain. However, someone firmly took hold of his arm and hauled him back upright. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Just as I thought; I can‚Äôt leave you alone like this.‚Äù Amane heard a fragile voice through his feverish haze. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll repay your favor.‚Äù Amane‚Äôs head swam as he tried to make sense of the words, but he quickly gave up. Before he understood what was happening, Mahiru had propped up his limp body and opened the door to his apartment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to help you inside. There‚Äôs no other way, so please forgive the intrusion.‚Äù Her tone of voice was quiet but left no room for argument. The fever-stricken Amane had no willpower to resist. He was pulled along, entering his apartment with a girl his own age for the first time in his life. It was true that he didn‚Äôt have a girlfriend to nurse him back to health, but it seemed that an angel had descended to care for him instead. Thoroughly addled with fever, Amane had forgotten all about the sorry state of his place until it was too late. It wasn‚Äôt until he saw the condition his home was in that he regretted ever letting Mahiru enter. His apartment was spacious. It even had a spare room in addition to the bedroom and main living space. It was quite an extravagant dwelling for a person living alone, but Amane‚Äôs parents were fairly well-off and had decided on this place after considering the safety of the neighborhood and the convenience of nearby transportation. Amane had always thought that spending so much money on housing was unnecessary. The apartment was much too large for a single person anyway. Still, his parents had insisted, and he wasn‚Äôt about to complain. Setting that aside, Amane did live alone, and he was a typical teenage boy. Things were not kept especially tidy.

        He realized that his head felt cool and pressed a hand to his forehead. When he did, his fingers registered a slightly starchy sensation, like cloth. There was a cooling sheet stuck to him. Amane was sure he didn‚Äôt have any of those at his place, and he looked up at Mahiru. ‚ÄúI brought it from home,‚Äù she answered immediately. Amane had no cooling sheets in his apartment‚Äîand no sports drinks, either. Mahiru must have brought that over as well. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Thank you. Sorry for all the trouble.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine.‚Äù There was nothing Amane could do but smile bitterly at Mahiru‚Äôs curt answer. Mahiru had only offered to play nurse because she felt guilty. It definitely didn‚Äôt mean that she genuinely wanted to spend time with Amane. He was sure of that. She was already talking with a boy she barely knew‚Äîand alone in his apartment no less. That she would make sure there were no misunderstandings about how she felt was only natural. ‚ÄúFor the time being, I brought you the medicine that was on top of your desk. It‚Äôs better to take it with something in your stomach‚Ä¶ Are you hungry at all?‚Äù Mahiru asked gently. ‚ÄúMm, a little bit,‚Äù Amane answered. ‚ÄúOh really? Well, in that case, I made some rice porridge, so you‚Äôre welcome to have some.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh, you made it yourself?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs there anyone else here but me? If you don‚Äôt want it, I‚Äôll eat it all alone.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôll eat it! Please let me eat it!‚Äù Amane had never imagined Mahiru preparing a homemade meal for him. For a moment, he was caught off guard. Frankly, he had no idea whether Mahiru even knew how to cook, but he‚Äôd never heard rumors of her failing cooking class, so he was fairly confident it wouldn‚Äôt be awful. Although Mahiru looked surprised at Amane‚Äôs sudden bow and insistence that he would eat her food, she nodded before handing him the thermometer that was sitting on the side table. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll bring it to you, so take your temperature first.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Amane said, taking the thermometer out of its sleeve. He began unbuttoning his shirt, and Mahiru quickly turned away. ‚ÄúDo it after I leave the room, please.‚Äù There was a slight rise in her voice, and Amane spied that the girl‚Äôs pale cheeks were tinged red.
Amane hadn‚Äôt thought twice about taking off his shirt in front of her. He didn‚Äôt consider it anything to worry about, but Mahiru was clearly flustered. Perhaps she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to seeing much skin. Mahiru‚Äôs alabaster cheeks were faintly rosy, and she kept her blushing face turned away, trembling. Even the tips of her ears appeared to be changing hue, making her shyness almost palpable. ‚Ä¶Ah, I think I kind of understand why all the other boys are always saying how cute she is. Amane had never denied that Mahiru was very pretty, but he‚Äôd also never had any special feelings for her beyond a commonplace appreciation for her gentle beauty. He had looked at her like something akin to a work of art and had been content to admire her like one would a distant masterpiece. Mahiru wasn‚Äôt some far-off thing anymore, though. She was in his apartment, looking slightly flustered and very shy. In that moment, Amane saw her as a girl and not some idol, and it was strangely adorable. The two didn‚Äôt have the kind of relationship where Amane could just up and say that he thought Mahiru looked cute, however. It would probably just come across as weird if he tried, which was why he kept his impressions to himself. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Well then, do you think you could go get the rice porridge?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúY-you don‚Äôt have to tell me,‚Äù Mahiru answered dismissively. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù She turned and made a swift exit, her footsteps pattering away. It took Mahiru some time to leave, maybe because she was trembling or maybe because of all the clutter. Probably the latter. After vacantly watching her go, Amane wondered again how things had turned out this way and let out a soft breath that was not quite a sigh. ‚Ä¶Well, I guess she just feels guilty over what happened. Normally, it would be unthinkable to follow a stranger into his apartment. It was too dangerous; she could be attacked or something. Mahiru taking such a chance on Amane must‚Äôve meant she was worried about him. Maybe his apparent lack of interest helped put her at ease. Either way, Amane didn‚Äôt think it mattered. He was certain Mahiru was only helping him out of a sense of obligation. Amane‚Äôs mind, still slightly delirious with fever, continued to wander as he waited.
Then came a hesitant knock at the door. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôve brought the porridge.‚Äù At the sound of Mahiru‚Äôs concerned voice from the next room, Amane remembered again that he had loosened his clothing in order to take his temperature. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt taken my temperature yet,‚Äù he called back. ‚ÄúI thought I told you to take it while I was out of the room, though‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, I spaced out.‚Äù Amane apologized meekly and stuck the thermometer in his armpit. After a few moments, it let out a muffled electronic beep. When he yanked it out and held it up to look at the screen, it showed a temperature of 38.3 degrees Celsius. It wasn‚Äôt bad enough to go to the hospital, but it was still pretty high. ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôm finished,‚Äù Amane said as he put his shirt back on. Mahiru entered with obvious aprehension, carrying a tray with a lidded bowl resting on it. She looked relieved, probably because Amane had fixed his clothes. ‚ÄúWhat was your temperature?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThirty-eight point three. I‚Äôll be better after I take some medicine and get some more sleep.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Over-the-counter medicine only treats the symptoms and won‚Äôt eliminate the virus itself, you know. You need to rest properly and let your immune system do its job.‚Äù Such harsh scolding, even if it was coming from a place of concern, embarrassed Amane. Mahiru sighed in exasperation and placed the tray and bowl on the side table, then opened the lid. Inside was rice porridge with pickled plums. It looked severely watered down‚Äîmaybe 70 percent porridge to 30 percent water. Perhaps Mahiru had done that intentionally because she‚Äôd thought it‚Äôd be easier on Amane‚Äôs stomach. She‚Äôd likely added the plums because of their reputation as being good for fighting colds. The dish wasn‚Äôt steaming, but it gave off a faint warmth. Amane guessed that Mahiru hadn‚Äôt brought it straight from the stove but had instead made sure to let it to cool down first. Ignoring Amane as he stared at the porridge, Mahiru ladled some into a smaller bowl with a clearly practiced hand. She had broken the pickled fruit up a bit for him and had apparently even neatly removed the pits. The red of the plums and the white of the rice mixed easily. ‚ÄúHere you go.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Various items were scattered all over the living room, and needless to say, there was the state of the bedroom. ‚ÄúThis is too pitiful to look at.‚Äù The angel, Amane‚Äôs savior, gave him a frank assessment of his living conditions. Such harshness was quite the contrast to her charming appearance. Amane could hardly argue‚Äîit really was a sorry sight. If he‚Äôd known that he‚Äôd be bringing a stranger into his home, he might have moved some things, perhaps tidied up a bit, but it was too late for that now. Mahiru let a sigh slip from her glossy lips, but undeterred, she set to moving Amane into his bedroom. They nearly tripped along the way, and Amane vowed to do some serious cleaning sometime soon. ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôm going out for a moment, so please go ahead and change clothes before I get back. You can do that, right?‚Äù Mahiru asked. ‚Äú‚Ä¶You‚Äôre coming back?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy conscience would never let me rest if I left you alone like this, even to sleep,‚Äù Mahiru responded bluntly, apparently feeling the same way now that Amane had felt toward her when she was soaking wet the day before. Amane did not argue any further. After Mahiru left the room, he obediently did as he was told and started changing out of his school uniform. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a mess in here; there‚Äôs nowhere to even step‚Ä¶ How can anyone live like this‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he was changing, Amane heard an exasperated voice, quietly coming from the next room, and felt quite ashamed. After changing clothes, he went to lie down and must have fallen asleep without realizing it, because when he managed to lift his heavy eyelids again, flaxen hair was the first thing he saw. Following the hair, Amane looked up to see Mahiru standing silently at his side, peering down at him. The whole scene felt like something out of a dream. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What time is it?‚Äù Amane asked, confused. ‚ÄúSeven in the evening,‚Äù Mahiru answered matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúYou slept for several hours.‚Äù As Amane propped himself up, Mahiru handed him some sports drink that she had poured into a cup. He accepted it gratefully and brought it to his lips, then finally was able to take a look at his surroundings. Maybe it was because he had slept, but he felt just a little bit better than before.

She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses.

She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed.

She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably.

She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment.

She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her.

            "brief_description": "A high school student who lives alone and is cared for by Mahiru. He appreciates Mahiru's care and is aware of her cold demeanor when discussing relationships. He is now aware that people would curse his name for being undeserving of Mahiru‚Äôs angelic attention. He is perceptive to Mahiru's emotional state and respects her privacy. He is now aware that Mahiru does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. He is now aware of Mahiru's dislike for her birthday and is captivated by her beauty and innocence. He realizes he might be in trouble as he is drawn to her. He is now aware that Shihoko has taken a liking to Mahiru and will likely continue to interfere in their lives. He is surprised to learn that Mahiru is not called by her first name by her parents. He trusts Mahiru and offers her a key to his apartment for convenience. He is now aware that Mahiru is growing more comfortable with their silly banter. He buys Mahiru a shortcake to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. He realizes he has become spoiled by Mahiru's cooking and decides to cook for himself. He acknowledges his overdependence on Mahiru and wants to learn to cook for himself. He is now grateful for Mahiru's help and acknowledges how much she does for him. He acknowledges that he is becoming reliant on Mahiru and wants her to continue cooking for him, admitting it is selfish of him to ask. He agrees to host a Christmas party for Itsuki and Chitose at his apartment but sets conditions on their behavior and departure time. He is now planning to order ready-made food for the party. He is aware that Mahiru used him as an excuse to turn down other dates. He expresses sympathy for Mahiru's situation. He is now forced to invite Mahiru into his apartment after she is spotted on her balcony by Itsuki and Chitose. He is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. He emphasizes the need for Itsuki and Chitose to keep their relationship a secret, fearing potential trouble if word gets out. He is now reminded of his mother due to Chitose's behavior. He intervenes when Chitose gets too close to Mahiru, reminding her to be respectful. He explains Chitose's personality to Mahiru. He is happy to hear that Mahiru sees him as someone she can trust, even though he wishes she hadn't called him incompetent. He admits to Itsuki that he is somewhat interested in Mahiru but believes she only wants a close friend. He is concerned that Chitose might be too persistent with Mahiru and considers cautioning her. He reflects on having his relationship with Mahiru discovered by Itsuki and Chitose, feeling both relieved and wistful. He is impressed by Mahiru's cooking and admits to being ruled by his stomach, finding happiness in her meals. He is selfishly inclined to keep her cooking all to himself. He compliments Mahiru's cooking, saying it tastes like happiness. He is flustered by Mahiru's rare smile and tries to change the subject. He is embarrassed about how much he was looking forward to spending time with Mahiru. He starts teaching Mahiru how to play a 2D game and helps her by physically guiding her through the game. He is flustered when he realizes his hands are almost completely covering Mahiru's, and he quickly pulls away. He finds Mahiru's tilting while playing a racing game adorable. He laughs at Mahiru's tilting and calls her charming. He is aware that Mahiru has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. He feels a strong desire to hold Mahiru close and pet her like a cat, but he restrains himself. He gives Mahiru a leather key holder as a Christmas present. He is not well-versed in fashion and prefers functional clothes. He is shocked that Shihoko sent Mahiru a picture of him from middle school. He is now aware of Mahiru's beauty and finds her appealing. He receives a houndstooth scarf from Mahiru as a Christmas present. He comments on Mahiru's more relaxed demeanor and cuter smiles compared to when they first met. He follows Mahiru onto the veranda and wraps a blanket around her shoulders, expressing concern for her catching a cold. He is reminded of his first encounter with Mahiru, when she nursed him back to health. He expresses gratitude to Mahiru for improving his life and standard of living. He acknowledges Mahiru's positive impact on his life and expresses gratitude for their relationship. He realizes he has taken a liking to their current lifestyle.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments.

She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen. She is now using Amane's spices and has decided on today's dishes. She is perceptive and can guess what Amane is thinking. She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty. She is now feeling extremely wary around people she isn't used to. She shakes Chitose's hand. She is exhausted and confused after dealing with Itsuki and Chitose. She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

            "brief_description": "A high school student who lives alone and is cared for by Mahiru. He appreciates Mahiru's care and is aware of her cold demeanor when discussing relationships. He is now aware that people would curse his name for being undeserving of Mahiru‚Äôs angelic attention. He is perceptive to Mahiru's emotional state and respects her privacy. He is now aware that Mahiru does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. He is now aware of Mahiru's dislike for her birthday and is captivated by her beauty and innocence. He realizes he might be in trouble as he is drawn to her. He is now aware that Shihoko has taken a liking to Mahiru and will likely continue to interfere in their lives. He is surprised to learn that Mahiru is not called by her first name by her parents. He trusts Mahiru and offers her a key to his apartment for convenience. He is now aware that Mahiru is growing more comfortable with their silly banter. He buys Mahiru a shortcake to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation.

He is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. He emphasizes the need for Itsuki and Chitose to keep their relationship a secret, fearing potential trouble if word gets out. He is now reminded of his mother due to Chitose's behavior. He intervenes when Chitose gets too close to Mahiru, reminding her to be respectful. He explains Chitose's personality to Mahiru. He is happy to hear that Mahiru sees him as someone she can trust, even though he wishes she hadn't called him incompetent. He admits to Itsuki that he is somewhat interested in Mahiru but believes she only wants a close friend. He is concerned that Chitose might be too persistent with Mahiru and considers cautioning her. He reflects on having his relationship with Mahiru discovered by Itsuki and Chitose, feeling both relieved and wistful. He is impressed by Mahiru's cooking and admits to being ruled by his stomach, finding happiness in her meals. He is selfishly inclined to keep her cooking all to himself. He compliments Mahiru's cooking, saying it tastes like happiness. He is flustered by Mahiru's rare smile and tries to change the subject. He is embarrassed about how much he was looking forward to spending time with Mahiru. He starts teaching Mahiru how to play a 2D game and helps her by physically guiding her through the game. He is flustered when he realizes his hands are almost completely covering Mahiru's, and he quickly pulls away. He finds Mahiru's tilting while playing a racing game adorable. He laughs at Mahiru's tilting and calls her charming. He is aware that Mahiru has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. He feels a strong desire to hold Mahiru close and pet her like a cat, but he restrains himself. He gives Mahiru a leather key holder as a Christmas present.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people. She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen.

She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship.

She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment.

She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student known for her academic and athletic achievements. She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people.

She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies.

She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane.

She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses.

She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty.

She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

He intervenes when Chitose gets too close to Mahiru, reminding her to be respectful. He explains Chitose's personality to Mahiru. He is happy to hear that Mahiru sees him as someone she can trust, even though he wishes she hadn't called him incompetent. He admits to Itsuki that he is somewhat interested in Mahiru but believes she only wants a close friend. He is concerned that Chitose might be too persistent with Mahiru and considers cautioning her. He reflects on having his relationship with Mahiru discovered by Itsuki and Chitose, feeling both relieved and wistful. He is impressed by Mahiru's cooking and admits to being ruled by his stomach, finding happiness in her meals. He is selfishly inclined to keep her cooking all to himself. He compliments Mahiru's cooking, saying it tastes like happiness. He is flustered by Mahiru's rare smile and tries to change the subject. He is embarrassed about how much he was looking forward to spending time with Mahiru. He starts teaching Mahiru how to play a 2D game and helps her by physically guiding her through the game. He is flustered when he realizes his hands are almost completely covering Mahiru's, and he quickly pulls away. He finds Mahiru's tilting while playing a racing game adorable. He laughs at Mahiru's tilting and calls her charming. He is aware that Mahiru has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. He feels a strong desire to hold Mahiru close and pet her like a cat, but he restrains himself. He gives Mahiru a leather key holder as a Christmas present. He is not well-versed in fashion and prefers functional clothes. He is shocked that Shihoko sent Mahiru a picture of him from middle school. He is now aware of Mahiru's beauty and finds her appealing. He receives a houndstooth scarf from Mahiru as a Christmas present. He comments on Mahiru's more relaxed demeanor and cuter smiles compared to when they first met. He follows Mahiru onto the veranda and wraps a blanket around her shoulders, expressing concern for her catching a cold. He is reminded of his first encounter with Mahiru, when she nursed him back to health. He expresses gratitude to Mahiru for improving his life and standard of living. He acknowledges Mahiru's positive impact on his life and expresses gratitude for their relationship. He realizes he has taken a liking to their current lifestyle. He is plunged into darkness due to a power outage and grabs Mahiru's wrist. He comforts Mahiru during the blackout and notices her flustered reaction when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

        Amane simply scratched his cheek and headed for the washroom to check on the breakers there. Once inside, he noticed that his reflection in the mirror had slightly flushed cheeks. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs weird,‚Äù he muttered as he turned away bashfully.

            "brief_description": "A beautiful, sweet, and popular high school student known for her academic and athletic achievements. She is Amane's next-door neighbor, perceived by him as an 'angel' due to her flawless appearance and accomplishments. She has a quiet, modest personality and tends to keep to herself, even when distressed, but seems to show concern for Amane and feels responsible for him catching a cold. She is easily flustered when Amane removes his shirt. She is now serving Amane rice porridge and scolding him for not resting properly. She is also a good caregiver, providing Amane with everything he needs to recover. She denies having a boyfriend and seems annoyed by the assumption that she would. She is sensitive about the topic of relationships and dislikes being seen as someone who would date multiple people. She is wary of unwanted attention from guys and appreciates Amane's understanding of her situation. She dislikes being called an 'angel' and is relieved to see Amane recovering. She is beautiful and surrounded by classmates, smiling quietly when spoken to. She expresses concern over Amane's poor diet and living habits, and brings him leftovers. She is genuinely concerned for Amane's health and living conditions, and offers him food and advice. She is now regularly cooking for Amane, motivated by concern for his well-being, and is aware of his unhealthy complexion. She expects Amane to return the container and appears as soon as he rings the doorbell. She is now giving Amane more food, claiming she made too much, and is aware of his potential allergies. She is economical and shops for the best prices. She cooks light and healthy meals for Amane daily. She is seen by Amane at the supermarket. She is meticulous and dutifully records everything she needs. She is economical and looks for the best prices. She is environmentally conscious and uses a reusable bag. She disapproves of Amane's unhealthy food choices. She is surprised when Amane takes her shopping bag. She is more direct and less sugarcoated with Amane than she is with others. She may have muttered \"Thanks\" to Amane. She is disgusted by the filth in Amane's apartment and offers to help him clean, criticizing his inability to clean up after himself. She is now helping Amane clean his apartment and is critical of his terrible habits. She is kind to Amane, despite her sharp words. She is good-hearted and would never steal from anyone. She is wearing a long white T-shirt and khaki-colored cargo pants. She is now instructing Amane on how to clean his apartment thoroughly. She is now directing Amane to dispose of magazines and sort through the clutter, emphasizing the need to work quickly. She slips on a piece of clothing in Amane's apartment, and Amane catches her. She is not visibly upset by the fall and continues cleaning with Amane. She is also affected by the close contact with Amane, but tries to hide it. She spends the entire day cleaning Amane's apartment and shows a hint of fatigue mixed with a sense of accomplishment. She is offered pizza by Amane as a thank you for her help. She reveals that she has never ordered pizza or been to a family restaurant. She admits that her family's help always prepared the meals and that she comes from a wealthy family. She is now eating pizza for the first time and enjoys it with delicate bites. She is more familiar with Amane when he is not at school. She reveals that she has been acting like her public persona since she was little and says that Amane makes her stomach turn in knots. She is delivering oden to Amane and expresses happiness that Amane can now invite friends over due to the cleanliness of his apartment. She shares meals with Amane out of self-satisfaction, because it's easy to cook for two, and because she enjoys treating people. She also appreciates that he genuinely enjoys her cooking without ulterior motives and is concerned about his eating habits. She is sitting alone in the park with a stiff expression, seemingly troubled by something. She sprains her ankle while helping a cat and is found by Amane. She is treated by Amane who creates an ice pack and applies a compress to her sprained ankle. She is surprised by Amane's first-aid skills. She is offered Amane's gym pants to cover her legs and accepts his offer to carry her home. She is carried home by Amane on his back to her front door and assures Amane that she has food prepared. She thanks Amane for his help. She is sitting out of gym class due to her sprained ankle and smiles at Amane, causing excitement among the boys. She returns Amane's clothes and confirms her ankle is healing. She expresses disinterest in Yuuta Kadowaki, stating they have no connection, and questions why Amane doesn't like her if looks are so important. She admits she is aware of her attractiveness and works hard to maintain her appearance. She is candid and doesn't put on an act with Amane. She brings Amane a boxed lunch with several side dishes, including croquettes and fried chicken. She proposes to cook at Amane's apartment in exchange for him paying for half the food expenses. She assures him that she's not worried about her safety because she believes he's harmless and not her type. She is now setting conditions for cooking at Amane's apartment, including sharing costs and responsibilities. She finds Amane's kitchen unused and is now preparing to cook in Amane's kitchen. She is now using Amane's spices and has decided on today's dishes. She is perceptive and can guess what Amane is thinking. She is now cooking a Japanese meal in Amane's kitchen, and is relieved when Amane compliments her cooking. She is pleased by Amane's honest enjoyment of her cooking and smiles gently. She is happy when Amane eats all of her cooking and is willing to continue cooking for Amane as long as she is free. She is shocked at Amane‚Äôs immediate reply when he asks her to continue cooking for him and breaks into a smile. She is a high-achieving student who finds studying easy and has already completed this year's coursework. She is aware of Amane's grades and placement in the ranking list. She sometimes displays a sad expression, hinting at underlying struggles, and is good at hiding her true feelings. She wants a whetstone for her birthday, and already owns several. She is a skilled housekeeper and noble young lady who spends a lot of time taking care of Amane. She is preparing dinner as usual and seems relaxed. She reveals that she does not celebrate her birthday and that it bothers her. She accepts a gift from Amane, but shrinks away at first. She appreciates the practicality of the hand cream Amane gives her. She receives a stuffed bear as a second birthday gift. She says she will treasure the stuffed bear. She reveals that she hates her birthday and normally dislikes receiving gifts from strangers, but she considers Amane not a stranger. She is so cute that Amane almost stroked her hair. She is puzzled by Amane's behavior. She is acting the same as usual and has a placid expression. She overhears Amane talking to himself and asks him curiously what is going on. She listens to Amane explain that his mother is sending fruit to his apartment. She offers to take some of the fruit and make lunch as a thank you. She agrees to hide in Amane's bedroom to avoid his mother. She is now hiding in Amane's bedroom. She dozes off in Amane's bedroom due to the warm temperature and full stomach. She is visibly flustered by Shihoko's overly familiar demeanor and is uncomfortable with the situation. She attempts to clarify that she and Amane are not dating, but her efforts are futile against Shihoko's misinterpretations. She is the reason Amane has been able to live so comfortably. She is exhausted by Shihoko's visit. She exchanges contact information with Shihoko. She expresses a subtle envy for Amane's close relationship with his mother. She seems envious of Amane's relationship with his mother. She reveals that she is not called by her first name by her parents, hinting at a strained relationship. She is aware that she is seen as a flawless angel by others, but lacks close friends who know her personally. She is called by her first name by Amane for the first time. She calls Amane by his first name for the first time. She returns Amane's spare key but is asked to keep it for convenience. She is persuaded by Amane to keep the spare key to his apartment. She playfully threatens to prank Amane by cleaning his apartment or filling his fridge with food, revealing her gentle nature. She is ranked first in the class. She is given a cake by Amane to celebrate her academic achievements, recognizing her hard work and wanting to show appreciation. She is troubled by being treated as special. She is not good at accepting kindness from others. She offers to feed Amane the cake. She is oblivious to the implications of feeding Amane cake and is confused when he reciprocates. She becomes embarrassed and realizes how he felt. She is embarrassed after Amane tells her to save the cake-feeding gesture for her female friends. She is carrying a shopping bag from the nearby stationery store. She is concerned about Amane's safety and offers to supervise his cooking attempts. She is now supervising Amane's attempt to cook stir-fried vegetables and an omelet. She bandages Amane's finger after he cuts himself and expresses concern for his safety, advising him to avoid frying food. She is now concerned about Amane's safety and offers to make fried foods for him if he asks. She makes a perfect omelet as a reference for Amane. She expresses a subtle loneliness at the thought of Amane learning to cook for himself and says she doesn't intend to stop cooking for him. She has no plans for Christmas. She is aware that she keeps her guard up in public and that hopeful suitors drown in their own tears when faced with her impregnable defenses. She sees Amane as a harmless puppy. She trusts Amane because he has never shown any romantic interest in her. She is used to spending Christmas alone. She expresses interest in playing video games with Amane on Christmas Day. She is spotted by Itsuki and Chitose when she goes onto her balcony to look at the snow. She is now in Amane's apartment. She is now trying to explain to Itsuki and Chitose how she and Amane first met and why they‚Äôd continued seeing each other. She is uncomfortable when Chitose compliments her beauty. She is now feeling extremely wary around people she isn't used to. She shakes Chitose's hand. She is exhausted and confused after dealing with Itsuki and Chitose. She admits that Itsuki and Chitose are lively and interesting. She expresses concern about heavy snow disrupting public transit. She enjoys watching the snow. She brings beef stew over to Amane's apartment for dinner and makes a pot pie. She notices Amane's strange expression. She made handmade mille-feuille for dessert. She is a skilled cook, preparing both pot pie and mille-feuille. She is pleased when Amane compliments her cooking, and a relieved smile emerges on her face. She reveals that someone important to her once said ‚ÄòMake sure you grab anyone who makes you happy by the stomach,‚Äô and she took those words to heart. She is touched when Amane says her cooking tastes like happiness. She confirms plans to meet Amane for lunch and games the next day and expresses that she is looking forward to it. She arrives at Amane's apartment the next day looking restless but pleased. She struggles with playing a 2D game, and Amane helps her by physically guiding her through the game. She is surprised but not upset when Amane touches her hands, clarifying that it's because he's not a stranger. She leans her whole body while playing a racing game, eventually falling into Amane's lap. She is slim and has a small build. Her cheeks flush and her body trembles from embarrassment. She is very cute. She has a lot of determination and is a hard worker. She is acting more like a regular teenage girl and less like a perfect young lady. She is acting like a kid. She smiles innocently and is presented with a leather key holder as a Christmas present. She compliments Amane's sense of style and reveals that Shihoko sent her a picture of him from middle school. She brushes Amane's bangs away from his face and comments that his eyes look livelier than they used to. She is now self-conscious around Amane. She gives Amane a houndstooth scarf as a Christmas present and prefers high-quality, durable items. She shows a relieved smile after Amane says the scarf is super warm. She is asked by Amane what is wrong when he stares at her. She covers Amane's face with the scarf he gave her when he compliments her, and she goes outside to the veranda to cool off. She is now bantering with Amane and reminiscing about their first meeting and his dirty apartment. She acknowledges that Amane is a lot of work and admits that she trusts him because he is not attracted to her. She expresses gratitude for Amane's presence in his life and exchanges early New Year's greetings with him. She is startled by the blackout and falls off the sofa. She trembles when Amane grabs her wrist. She admits to disliking sudden darkness and finds comfort in Amane's presence during the blackout. She is flustered and retreats to the kitchen when the power returns.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        It was quite enjoyable to write those changes in their emotions and their relationship. I think it‚Äôs good to have those kinds of stories where people slowly get to know each other, too. As for what I want to say through my work, well, I think slow and steady is just the best! That‚Äôs what I have to say. This work underwent some revisions in the time between it first being published online to when it was made into a book, but honestly, Amane and Mahiru aren‚Äôt quite focused directly on each other yet. The real fun begins in Volume 2. I‚Äôm still going to take things slow and steady as the series continues, but I plan for them both to take steps toward the other. Both characters having unrequited love is the best! I gave our heroine Mahiru her nickname of angel, but it was the illustrations that really made her live up to that nickname. My thanks to Hazano Kazutake. You really made Mahiru, aka the school angel, even more charming. Actually, when I met with the head editor, I happened to put forth the idea that Kazutake would be good for the illustrations. Imagine my surprise when I heard the offer had been accepted! I was so excited to work with a master whose drawings I‚Äôd admired for so long. Thank you so much for taking charge of the illustrations! You can tell from looking at Kazutake‚Äôs incredibly charming illustrations, but every character in this book is cute. Reviewing the final drawings was almost too much for me. The angel actually looks heavenly. I am just brimming with gratitude for your incredible work! Well then, we‚Äôve come to the end, but I still need to express my gratitude to everyone who‚Äôs helped me along the way. To the lead editor, who put so much effort into getting this book published, to everyone in the GA Books editorial section, to everyone in the sales department, to the proofreaders, to Hazano Kazutake, to everyone at the printing office, and to all of you who‚Äôve picked up this book, I extend my humblest gratitude. As I lay down my pen, it is my sincerest wish that we will all meet again in the next volume. Thank you so much for reading all the way to the end!
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù Amane let out a panicked yelp as he was suddenly plunged into darkness. The weather had been calling for storms all week due to an unusual pressure front, and indeed, the sounds of thunder and heavy rain outside were unceasing. But Amane hadn‚Äôt expected it to get bad enough to knock out the power. After an especially loud crack of thunder, the lights went out all at once, from the bulbs to the television. It was a total blackout. Luckily, his computer had been unplugged, so it likely hadn‚Äôt suffered any damage, but he would have to check the other appliances later. ‚ÄúDo you have your phone? I left mine in a backpack in my bedroom.‚Äù He wished he had a flashlight handy, but a phone would have to do. Unfortunately, Amane had left his in his room, but he figured Mahiru would have hers. She had been sitting next to him, working on problems in a textbook, when the lights cut out. However, there was no reply. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Mahiru?‚Äù he called out anxiously. Amane thought he felt something tugging on his sleeve. He asked what happened, and still, there was no answer. He blindly extended a hand toward where Mahiru had been sitting, and brushed up against something slender that he assumed was Mahiru‚Äôs arm‚Ä¶ It was easy to tell that she was trembling as she started and pulled away. There was a loud thud as something fell down, and then a groan. He heard a grumbling voice come from the floor. ‚ÄúWhat a disgrace‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Um, sorry I startled you.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶No. I startled myself; that‚Äôs all.‚Äù Mahiru didn‚Äôt seem particularly bothered by her fall from the sofa as she groped around and found her original position. Amane was worried that she had landed hard on something, but she didn‚Äôt seem to be in pain or anything. Then, perhaps while Mahiru searched for the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt again, her fingertips brushed against him lightly. It tickled, and without thinking, he grabbed her slim wrist, and she started trembling again. This time, she didn‚Äôt fall off the sofa.
‚ÄúLooking for something?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Are you being sarcastic?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy in the world would I be?‚Äù ‚ÄúI thought you would make fun of me for getting so shaken up by a little blackout‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not that much of an ass.‚Äù Usually, Mahiru was very levelheaded and not the kind to scare easily‚Äîbut she was still a teenager, and even an adult could feel anxious if the power suddenly went out. Outside, the thunder rolled on, accompanying the endless drumming of raindrops, but inside the apartment, it was quiet and still. Mahiru continued fiddling nervously with the hem of Amane‚Äôs shirt, but she didn‚Äôt make any moves to brush off his hand. He had been a little nervous about touching her at first, but now he gently squeezed her hand. ‚Äú‚Ä¶So I guess you‚Äôre not a big fan of the dark?‚Äù He spoke to her softly and could more or less make out that she shook her head. ‚Äú‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt hate it, but‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶I just don‚Äôt like it when it‚Äôs bright one moment and dark the next‚Äîthat‚Äôs all.‚Äù ‚ÄúAh, okay.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really afraid of the dark, and I don‚Äôt feel scared.‚Äù ‚ÄúSure, yeah.‚Äù Mahiru stubbornly dismissed her fears in an even more aloof tone than usual, but Amane had spent enough time with her to know it was all an adorable bluff. He smiled slightly, thinking that the cover of darkness could be a good thing, but Mahiru added in a small voice, ‚Äú‚Ä¶There‚Äôs just one thing.‚Äù He stopped smiling and leaned slightly toward Mahiru. ‚ÄúHmm?‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶When we sit like this, I know I‚Äôm not alone, and I feel better,‚Äù Mahiru mumbled. She sounded relieved. ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Amane, and he gently squeezed her hand again. ‚Äú‚Ä¶The power‚Äôs back on. I‚Äôm going to check my appliances.‚Äù The moment the lights in the room flashed to life, Mahiru gently slipped out of Amane‚Äôs hold and stood up. Amane smiled wryly at her transparent change in attitude, but he noticed that the ears poking out from under her flaxen hair were red and decided to not say anything. He stood up, too, to go look at the circuit breaker and check that nothing had malfunctioned. When he passed Mahiru, he heard a small ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù and couldn‚Äôt help but stare at her. In a fluster, Mahiru turned away quickly and went to the kitchen to escape.

Appendix Afterword Yen Newsletter Stay up to date On Light Novels by Downloading our mobile App Zerobooks Android Zerobooks IOS Download all your Favorite Light Novels Jnovels.com Prologue Preparing the Perfect Stage! I honestly can‚Äôt remember what catalyzed this desire. All I know is I‚Äôve admired shadowbrokers for as long as I can remember. Was it a certain anime? Or was it a manga‚Äîor a movie? Eh, I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter. I was all in for anything that featured a mastermind, or an eminence in shadow as I like to call them. These characters were never the protagonists or Ô¨Ånal bosses but were relegated to a role behind the scenes where they Ô¨Çaunted their powers and meddled in the aÔ¨Äairs of others. I‚Äôve always looked up to the men in the shadows. I wanted to be one of them. Think of children who worship their favorite superheroes. That was me but with master puppeteers. Well, there was one thing that set us apart: My reverence for them wasn‚Äôt short-lived. In fact, it buried itself deeper in my heart, never dying out and always guiding me through life. To become stronger, I learned everything from karate to boxing, from swordplay to mixed martial arts. I hammed it up during all my practices, concealing my true power from the world and preparing for the fated day. At school, I played the part of being pleasantly mediocre, an unassuming face in the crowd. Like an NPC in a game or a part of the mob. I didn‚Äôt do any harm. But behind this facade of normalcy, I was training full throttle. That‚Äôs how I spent my entire youth. But as time passed, an uneasy feeling started to haunt me: I was due for a reality check. Yeah, that‚Äôs right. This was all for nothing. I realized I‚Äôd never become as powerful as shadow commanders in the stories. It didn‚Äôt matter how hard I trained in martial arts. Sure, I could clobber a few punks‚Ä¶but that was it. It‚Äôd be a tough Ô¨Åght if anyone drew a gun, and if I was surrounded by soldiers in full gear, I‚Äôd be toast, donezo, old news. The idea of a shadowbroker getting curb stomped by some soldiers‚Ä¶ Ha! Ridiculous!

      FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
      I pick up and put on my underwear, which I‚Äôd chucked to the side, and wiggle my arms through the sleeves of my school uniform. I have yet to pick up these secret magical skills, but I‚Äôve been starting to feel the eÔ¨Äects of my training, I think, of late. Like right now. I can see Ô¨Çashing lights going oÔ¨Ä in my mind and sense the world is spinning. It could be magic‚Ä¶or auras‚Ä¶ In either case, I‚Äôm feeling its eÔ¨Äects‚Äîthat‚Äôs for sure. I‚Äôm proud to announce that I‚Äôve completed another successful session. When I‚Äôm in the thick of it, I rip oÔ¨Ä every single article of clothing and get buck naked in the forest. It makes me one with the universe. I bash my skull into the trunk of a giant tree to physically force out my worldly thoughts. Plus, it stimulates my brain and urges my latent powers to awaken. You know, I‚Äôm all about logic when it comes to these things. Yeah, everything‚Äôs beginning to get all blurry right about now. It‚Äôs a sensation comparable to giving myself a concussion. I make my way out of the forest with the lightest of footsteps, feeling like I‚Äôm treading on clouds. Just then, I see light‚Äîtwo beams Ô¨Çoating in the air and slicing through space. How strange. They‚Äôre beckoning me, guiding me somewhere. ‚ÄúMa-magic‚Ä¶?‚Äù I whisper, tiptoeing toward the illumination. It must be‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs gotta be! I Ô¨Ånally found the powers of the unknown! I notice that I‚Äôve gone from walking to sprinting, tripping over the roots of trees and continuing to stagger forward‚Äîon and on like a beast in the forest. ‚ÄúMagic! Magic! Magic! MAGIC, MAGIC, MAGIC!!!!!‚Äù I chant, bounding toward the lights and ready to snatch them out of midair‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶?‚Äù As a pair of headlights Ô¨Çood my vision with a blinding whiteness, I hear the shrill whine of a sudden brake ringing and ringing. And then a collision. Its impact pierces through my body‚Ä¶ And my magic‚Ä¶ In conclusion, I was able to Ô¨Ånd magical powers. When I open my eyes, I sense that I‚Äôm surrounded by its energy, though I gotta admit it looks diÔ¨Äerent from the two lights. Eh, no biggie. Oh, and one other small detail: As a side eÔ¨Äect, I manage to reincarnate. I bet I opened a door to another world when I found magic or something. Whatever.
As for right now, I‚Äôm a baby boy, a few months old. I only recently started forming thoughts, but it‚Äôs still hard for me to guess how much time has elapsed at any given moment. Plus, I don‚Äôt know any words, but I guess it‚Äôs plenty to recognize that this civilization is more or less the same as Europe in the Middle Ages. But none of that‚Äôs important. I‚Äôve acquired magical powers. That‚Äôs the end-all be-all. I couldn‚Äôt care less about how it happened or any bonus features. I notice magic as soon as I start displaying glimmers of consciousness. All around me, I can see minuscule grains of light Ô¨Çoating and shimmering. It reminds me of those times in my past life when I frolicked through a Ô¨Åeld of Ô¨Çowers stark naked‚Äîto train and Ô¨Ånd spirits, obviously. As it turns out, my training wasn‚Äôt a total waste after all. I mean, my ability to detect this energy is proof enough, and I can control it as easily as my limbs. It‚Äôs comparable to when I strapped my naked body to a cross, a nod to Jesus‚Ä¶or maybe when I Ô¨Çip- Ô¨Çopped religions and danced around in prayer in my birthday suit‚Ä¶ I bet every little thing in my training sessions helped me in the long run. It‚Äôs already taught me that I can get stronger. Plus, time is of no consequence for a baby. I‚Äôm ready to use these years to train and become an eminence in shadow, once and for all‚Ä¶ Oops, I think I‚Äôve made a doodie. Which reminds me. I heard somewhere that birds let their droppings dribble out involuntarily, and I think human babies are the same. I can Ô¨Åght the good Ô¨Åght with logic and reasoning, but it feels as though my instincts take over, whispering Just do it in my ear. That said, this is me we‚Äôre talking about. I spent my waking hours training in my past life. Pooling together all the strength in my body, I tighten my sphincter, buying me some time‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúWwwaaaahhhhh!‚Äù ‚Ä¶to summon people. I think it‚Äôs been ten years. You know, magic is something else. It means I can surpass the bodily limitations of humans: lift ginormous boulders with a single Ô¨Ånger, dash twice as fast as a horse, leap higher than a house. That said, I‚Äôm no match for nukes.
Well, I know my defenses will increase with my magical capacity, but have you seen the Ô¨Årepower of those weapons on Earth? There was a time when I contemplated forgetting about them entirely, ‚Äôcause we don‚Äôt have nukes in this world. But what good is a master puppeteer who settles for less? No good. Not at all. That means my next mission is to become strong enough to beat weapons of mass destruction. After extensive research and training, I found one potential solution, which I‚Äôve been incorporating into my daily experiments. Oh yeah. And it seems I‚Äôve been born into a noble family. For generations, members of this family have trained to become dark knights, who use magic to power up and slay enemies in battle. And as my family‚Äôs rising star of a son (‚Ä¶NOT), I‚Äôm living my days as your average apprentice. After all, shadowbrokers need to be extremely selective about when, where, and to whom they reveal their powers. Yeah‚Ä¶I‚Äôll lie in wait until then. I know I‚Äôm not exerting my true potential and that I am cutting corners, but I learned some skills as an apprentice that have come in handy. Like how magic is used on the battleÔ¨Åeld in this world. It‚Äôs been a good opportunity for me to reÔ¨Çect on my own techniques. To be completely honest, it‚Äôs clear to me the Ô¨Åghting styles from my past life were a hundred times more logical and reÔ¨Åned than the ones here. I mean, look at any contemporary martial arts battle. These Ô¨Åghters rebuke unnecessary movements, drawing from various combat schools and whittling them down to the cr√®me de la cr√®me. This creates the conditions for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù Ô¨Åght. It relies on the rules of the game, of course, but this mental attitude can be used to identify the best of the best in any situation. And then consider this world. First and foremost, their Ô¨Åghting techniques stay in their country of origin. Which means diÔ¨Äerent schools of combat don‚Äôt cross borders. Plus, there are certain secret skills that countries won‚Äôt allow out of their jurisdiction‚Äînot that we‚Äôd be able to spread them to begin with, since no forms of media are readily available to us. This means we can‚Äôt combine techniques from other forms of Ô¨Åghting, much less reject or improve our own.

      MAIN TEXT EXCERPT:
      Let‚Äôs say I trained for ten more years‚Äîor that I became the greatest martial artist in the world. I‚Äôd still get rekt by a gang of commandos. Or maybe I‚Äôd manage to escape by the skin of my teeth or train hard enough to Ô¨Åght back. It‚Äôs all in the realm of possibility. But even if I somehow managed to do that, these guys could set oÔ¨Ä a nuke and vaporize me in an instant. There is a limit to the human body. That much I know. That said, my master puppeteers would never be taken down by a nuke. Which means I needed to be impervious to them, too. What does one need to survive a nuclear attack? Is it the ability to pack a punch? Could it be a body of steel? How about unlimited stamina? Wrong, wrong, and wrong again. You need a totally diÔ¨Äerent kind of power. Some call it magic. Others, mana. Or chi, or aura, or‚Ä¶you get the point. Anything will do. I needed to obtain this clandestine ability. I‚Äôd managed to reach this conclusion when I Ô¨Ånally confronted reality head-on. I‚Äôll try to explain. Let‚Äôs say someone is on a quest for magical powers. Anyone would think they‚Äôre nuts. Hell, I know I would. I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd gone bonkers. But consider this: No one in the world has proved that magic exists‚Äîor disproved it. I couldn‚Äôt Ô¨Ånd these powers with my sanity intact. I had to dive to the depths of lunacy. I started training in a new way that was damn near impossible. After all, no one knows how to acquire magic, mana, chi, auras, or what have you. I practiced Zen meditation; I braved the puriÔ¨Åcation ceremony of standing under waterfalls; I focused my entire being inward; I fasted; I mastered the art of yoga; I converted religions; I searched for holy spirits; I prayed to god; I strapped myself to a cross. There was no right answer, which meant I groped my way through the darkness and sprinted down my chosen path. Which brings us here. I‚Äôm just about ready to start my Ô¨Ånal summer as a high schooler, and I‚Äôve yet to discover magic or mana or chi or auras‚Ä¶ It is already dark by the time I Ô¨Ånish my daily training session.

He is going to Hogwarts. He sleeps under Hagrid's coat. He wakes up in the hut and is happy to see the sunlight and the owl. He realizes he has no money to buy his school supplies. He learns that his parents left him money in Gringotts, the wizarding bank. He learns that Gringotts is located hundreds of miles under London. He learns that there is a Ministry of Magic that keeps magic a secret from Muggles. He is going to London to buy his school supplies. He is taken to the Leaky Cauldron by Hagrid, and is surprised when everyone recognizes him and welcomes him back. He is greeted as a celebrity at the Leaky Cauldron and meets Professor Quirrell.

He explains that Voldemort disappeared the same night he tried to kill Harry. He threatens Uncle Vernon with his umbrella when he insults Harry's parents. He reminds Harry of the odd things that have happened when he was scared or angry to prove he is a wizard. He insists that Harry will attend Hogwarts, leading to a confrontation with Uncle Vernon. He asserts that Harry's name has been down for Hogwarts since birth and that he will be under Dumbledore's tutelage. He turns Dudley into a pig, but fails. He was expelled from Hogwarts in his third year and his wand was snapped in half, but Dumbledore let him stay on as gamekeeper. He is not supposed to do magic. He is asleep on the collapsed sofa. He tells Harry to pay the owl for delivering the newspaper and to use Knuts. He is pulling on his huge boots. He reassures Harry that his parents left him money. He explains that they will be visiting Gringotts, the wizarding bank run by goblins. He also needs to visit Gringotts for Dumbledore. He uses magic to speed up the boat journey back to the mainland, but asks Harry not to mention it. He reads the Daily Prophet. He explains the role of the Ministry of Magic and its Minister, Cornelius Fudge. He expresses his desire to own a dragon. He knits what looks like a canary-yellow circus tent. He is unfamiliar with Muggle transportation. He takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron. He introduces Harry to Professor Quirrell and explains that he is usually nervous. He reveals the entrance to Diagon Alley by tapping a specific spot on a brick wall in the Leaky Cauldron's courtyard.

He explains the wizarding currency to Harry. He retrieves a mysterious package from vault 713 for Dumbledore. He hates the Gringotts carts and wants a pick-me-up at the Leaky Cauldron.

He resembles his father, with a large, pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes and thick, blond hair. He is greedy and prone to tantrums when he feels he is not getting enough. He pretends to cry to get his way. He throws a tantrum when his knickerbocker glory isn't big enough. He wants to see the big, poisonous snakes at the zoo and whines at his father to make the snake move. He exaggerates the snake's aggression after its escape. He breaks his new cine-camera, crashes his remote-control airplane, and knocks down Mrs. Figg on his racing bike. He is the leader of his gang and enjoys Harry-hunting. He is attending Smeltings and wears a maroon tailcoat, orange knickerbockers, and a flat straw hat called a boater. He carries his Smeltings stick everywhere. He is curious about Harry's letter and tries to read it. He throws a tantrum when Harry is moved into his second bedroom. He is sent to get the mail by Uncle Vernon, and finds another letter for Harry. He gets hit by the Smeltings stick during a fight over the letter. He is amazed that someone wants to talk to Harry so badly. He is taken away by the Dursleys to escape the letters. He is hit around the head by his father for trying to pack his television, video and computer in his sports bag. He is taken to a shack on a rock in the sea by the Dursleys, and complains that he cannot watch 'The Great Humberto' on television. He is given a bed on the moth-eaten sofa in the shack. He is woken up by the knocking on the door of the shack and asks where the cannon is. He hides behind his mother, terrified. He fidgets when Hagrid is cooking sausages. He is given a pig's tail by Hagrid.",

He was increasingly worried about the connection between the Potters and the strange events occurring and hopes to avoid any involvement with them. He indulges Dudley's desires and admires his son's greed. He tells Harry to comb his hair and warns him against any 'funny business'. He enjoys complaining about various things, including Harry and motorbikes. He taps on the glass at the zoo to try and make the snake move. He is furious about the snake incident and punishes Harry. He is proud of Dudley in his Smeltings uniform. He is alarmed and terrified by Harry's letter and prevents him from reading it. He burns Harry's letter and moves him to Dudley's second bedroom. He wrestles Dudley to get the new letter addressed to Harry. He sleeps in front of the door to prevent Harry from getting the mail and nails up the letter-box. He tears the letters into pieces and nails up the letterbox. He hums 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' and boards up the doors. He makes furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy. He seizes Harry and throws him into the hall. He decides to leave. He drives aimlessly, ending up in various locations, trying to shake off the letters. He hits Dudley round the head for trying to pack his television, video and computer in his sports bag. He drives his family to a shack on a rock in the sea to escape the letters. He is in a good mood, thinking no one can reach them to deliver post. He brings a rifle with him to the shack. He is disarmed by Hagrid, who bends the rifle into a knot. He tells Dudley not to touch anything Hagrid gives him. He whispers 'Mimblewimble' when Hagrid is angry. He forbids Hagrid from telling Harry anything. He is ashen-faced and angry, and tries to stop Harry from going with Hagrid. He dismisses Hagrid's story as rubbish. He expresses his belief that Harry is strange and that his parents were weirdos who deserved their fate. He is silenced by Hagrid's threat. He insists that Harry will attend Stonewall High and not Hogwarts, leading to a confrontation with Hagrid. He is terrified of Hagrid.",

        Right, that should be enough fer a couple o‚Äô terms, we‚Äôll keep the rest safe for yeh.‚Äô He turned to Griphook. ‚ÄòVault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?‚Äô ‚ÄòOne speed only,‚Äô said Griphook. They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. DIAGON ALLEY 59 They went rattling over an underground ravine and Harry leant over the side to try and see what was down at the dark bottom but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole. ‚ÄòStand back,‚Äô said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away. ‚ÄòIf anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they‚Äôd be sucked through the door and trapped in there,‚Äô said Griphook. ‚ÄòHow often do you check to see if anyone‚Äôs inside?‚Äô Harry asked. ‚ÄòAbout once every ten years,‚Äô said Griphook, with a rather nasty grin. Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top- security vault, Harry was sure, and he leant forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least ‚Äì but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask. ‚ÄòCome on, back in this infernal cart, and don‚Äôt talk to me on the way back, it‚Äôs best if I keep me mouth shut,‚Äô said Hagrid. * One wild cart-ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight out- side Gringotts. Harry didn‚Äôt know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn‚Äôt have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he‚Äôd had in his whole life ‚Äì more money than even Dudley had ever had. ‚ÄòMight as well get yer uniform,‚Äô said Hagrid, nodding towards Madam Malkin‚Äôs Robes for All Occasions. ‚ÄòListen, Harry would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.‚Äô He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin‚Äôs shop alone, feeling nervous.
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve. ‚ÄòHogwarts, dear?‚Äô she said, when Harry started to speak. ‚ÄòGot the lot here ‚Äì another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.‚Äô In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him, slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length. 60 HARRY POTTER ‚ÄòHullo,‚Äô said the boy, ‚ÄòHogwarts too?‚Äô ‚ÄòYes,‚Äô said Harry. ‚ÄòMy father‚Äôs next door buying my books and mother‚Äôs up the street looking at wands,‚Äô said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. ‚ÄòThen I‚Äôm going to drag them off to look at racing brooms. I don‚Äôt see why first-years can‚Äôt have their own. I think I‚Äôll bully father into getting me one and I‚Äôll smuggle it in somehow.‚Äô Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley. ‚ÄòHave you got your own broom?‚Äô the boy went on. ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô said Harry. ‚ÄòPlay Quidditch at all?‚Äô ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch could be. ‚ÄòI do ‚Äì Father says it‚Äôs a crime if I‚Äôm not picked to play for my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you‚Äôll be in yet?‚Äô ‚ÄòNo,‚Äô said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute. ‚ÄòWell, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I‚Äôll be in Slytherin, all our family have been ‚Äì imagine being in Hufflepuff, I think I‚Äôd leave, wouldn‚Äôt you?‚Äô ‚ÄòMmm,‚Äô said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more interesting. ‚ÄòI say, look at that man!‚Äô said the boy suddenly, nodding towards the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry and pointing at two large ice-creams to show he couldn‚Äôt come in. ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs Hagrid,‚Äô said Harry, pleased to know something the boy didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄòHe works at Hogwarts.‚Äô ‚ÄòOh,‚Äô said the boy, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve heard of him. He‚Äôs a sort of servant, isn‚Äôt he?‚Äô ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs the gamekeeper,‚Äô said Harry. He was liking the boy less and less every second. ‚ÄòYes, exactly.
I heard he‚Äôs a sort of savage ‚Äì lives in a hut in the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do magic and ends up setting fire to his bed.‚Äô ‚ÄòI think he‚Äôs brilliant,‚Äô said Harry coldly. ‚ÄòDo you?‚Äô said the boy, with a slight sneer. ‚ÄòWhy is he with you? Where are your parents?‚Äô ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre dead,‚Äô said Harry shortly. He didn‚Äôt feel much like going into the matter with this boy. ‚ÄòOh, sorry,‚Äô said the other, not sounding sorry at all. ‚ÄòBut they DIAGON ALLEY 61 were our kind, weren‚Äôt they?‚Äô ‚ÄòThey were a witch and wizard, if that‚Äôs what you mean.‚Äô ‚ÄòI really don‚Äôt think they should let the other sort in, do you? They‚Äôre just not the same, they‚Äôve never been brought up to know our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families. What‚Äôs your surname, anyway?‚Äô But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs you done, my dear,‚Äô and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy, hopped down from the footstool. ‚ÄòWell, I‚Äôll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,‚Äô said the drawling boy. Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice-cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts). ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äô said Hagrid. ‚ÄòNothing,‚Äô Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed colour as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, ‚ÄòHagrid, what‚Äôs Quidditch?‚Äô ‚ÄòBlimey, Harry, I keep forgettin‚Äô how little yeh know ‚Äì not knowin‚Äô about Quidditch!‚Äô ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt make me feel worse,‚Äô said Harry. He told Hagrid about the pale boy in Madam Malkin‚Äôs. ‚Äò‚Äì and he said people from Muggle families shouldn‚Äôt even be allowed in ‚Äì‚Äô ‚ÄòYer not from a Muggle family. If he‚Äôd known who yeh were ‚Äì he‚Äôs grown up knowin‚Äô yer name if his parents are wizardin‚Äô folk ‚Äì you saw ‚Äôem in the Leaky Cauldron. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o‚Äô the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in ‚Äôem in a long line o‚Äô Muggles ‚Äì look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!‚Äô ‚ÄòSo what is Quidditch?‚Äô ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs our sport. Wizard sport.

        Outside the apothecary‚Äôs, Hagrid checked Harry‚Äôs list again. ‚ÄòJust yer wand left ‚Äì oh yeah, an‚Äô I still haven‚Äôt got yeh a birth- day present.‚Äô Harry felt himself go red. ‚ÄòYou don‚Äôt have to ‚Äì‚Äô ‚ÄòI know I don‚Äôt have to. Tell yeh what, I‚Äôll get yer animal. Not a toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh‚Äôd be laughed at ‚Äì an‚Äô I don‚Äô like cats, they make me sneeze. I‚Äôll get yer an owl. All the kids want owls, they‚Äôre dead useful, carry yer post an‚Äô everythin‚Äô.‚Äô DIAGON ALLEY 63 Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now carried a large cage which held a beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn‚Äôt stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. ‚ÄòDon‚Äô mention it,‚Äô said Hagrid gruffly. ‚ÄòDon‚Äô expect you‚Äôve had a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now ‚Äì only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best wand.‚Äô A magic wand ... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to. The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 BC. A single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single spindly chair which Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of new questions which had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic. ‚ÄòGood afternoon,‚Äô said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair. An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through the gloom of the shop. ‚ÄòHello,‚Äô said Harry awkwardly. ‚ÄòAh yes,‚Äô said the man. ‚ÄòYes, yes. I thought I‚Äôd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.‚Äô It wasn‚Äôt a question. ‚ÄòYou have your mother‚Äôs eyes.
It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work.‚Äô Mr Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy. ‚ÄòYour father, on the other hand, favoured a mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for trans- figuration. Well, I say your father favoured it ‚Äì it‚Äôs really the wand that chooses the wizard, of course.‚Äô Mr Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were 64 HARRY POTTER almost nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes. ‚ÄòAnd that‚Äôs where ...‚Äô Mr Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry‚Äôs forehead with a long, white finger. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,‚Äô he said softly. ‚ÄòThirteen and a half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and in the wrong hands ... Well, if I‚Äôd known what that wand was going out into the world to do ...‚Äô He shook his head and then, to Harry‚Äôs relief, spotted Hagrid. ‚ÄòRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again ... Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn‚Äôt it?‚Äô ‚ÄòIt was, sir, yes,‚Äô said Hagrid. ‚ÄòGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled?‚Äô said Mr Ollivander, suddenly stern. ‚ÄòEr ‚Äì yes, they did, yes,‚Äô said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve still got the pieces, though,‚Äô he added brightly. ‚ÄòBut you don‚Äôt use them?‚Äô said Mr Ollivander sharply. ‚ÄòOh, no, sir,‚Äô said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke. ‚ÄòHmmm,‚Äô said Mr Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look. ‚ÄòWell, now ‚Äì Mr Potter. Let me see.‚Äô He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. ‚ÄòWhich is your wand arm?‚Äô ‚ÄòEr ‚Äì well, I‚Äôm right-handed,‚Äô said Harry. ‚ÄòHold out your arm. That‚Äôs it.‚Äô He measured Harry from shoul- der to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and round his head. As he measured, he said, ‚ÄòEvery Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers and the heartstrings of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons or phoenixes are quite the same.
And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard‚Äôs wand.‚Äô Harry suddenly realised that the tape measure, which was meas- uring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes. ‚ÄòThat will do,‚Äô he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor. ‚ÄòRight then, Mr Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.‚Äô Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a DIAGON ALLEY 65 bit, but Mr Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once. ‚ÄòMaple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try ‚Äì‚Äô Harry tried ‚Äì but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr Ollivander. ‚ÄòNo, no ‚Äì here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.‚Äô Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become. ‚ÄòTricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we‚Äôll find the perfect match here somewhere ‚Äì I wonder, now ‚Äì yes, why not ‚Äì unusual combi- nation ‚Äì holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.‚Äô Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr Ollivander cried, ‚ÄòOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ...‚Äô He put Harry‚Äôs wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, ‚ÄòCurious ... curious ...‚Äô ‚ÄòSorry,‚Äô said Harry, ‚Äòbut what‚Äôs curious?‚Äô Mr Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare. ‚ÄòI remember every wand I‚Äôve ever sold, Mr Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather ‚Äì just one other.

        It‚Äôs like ‚Äì like football in the Muggle world ‚Äì everyone follows Quidditch ‚Äì played up in the air on broomsticks and there‚Äôs four balls ‚Äì sorta hard ter explain the rules.‚Äô ‚ÄòAnd what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?‚Äô ‚ÄòSchool houses. There‚Äôs four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o‚Äô duffers, but ‚Äì‚Äô ‚ÄòI bet I‚Äôm in Hufflepuff,‚Äô said Harry gloomily. ‚ÄòBetter Hufflepuff than Slytherin,‚Äô said Hagrid darkly. ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs 62 HARRY POTTER not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn‚Äôt in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.‚Äô ‚ÄòVol‚Äì sorry ‚Äì You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?‚Äô ‚ÄòYears an‚Äô years ago,‚Äô said Hagrid. They bought Harry‚Äôs school books in a shop called Flourish and Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these. Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more) by Professor Vindictus Viridian. ‚ÄòI was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.‚Äô ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not sayin‚Äô that‚Äôs not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,‚Äô said Hagrid. ‚ÄòAn‚Äô anyway, yeh couldn‚Äô work any of them curses yet, yeh‚Äôll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.‚Äô Hagrid wouldn‚Äôt let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (‚ÄòIt says pewter on yer list‚Äô), but they got a nice set of scales for weighing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited the apothecary‚Äôs, which was fascinating enough to make up for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor, jars of herbs, dried roots and bright powders lined the walls, bundles of feath- ers, strings of fangs and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

            "brief_description": "A tall and muscular swordswoman with animal-like ears and a tail, and dark brown skin. Known as a Sword King, she is highly skilled in the Sword God Style. She accompanies Rudeus and is his sword instructor and travel companion. She swiftly kills the two kidnappers. She was an adventurer in the past and shares her experiences to motivate Eris to learn. She describes her old adventuring party and their roles. She explains the difference between warriors, swordsmen, and knights. She uses the Sword of Light technique. She is able to influence Eris to attend all her lessons. Rudeus seeks her help to convince Eris of the importance of learning division. She recounts a story of surviving in a labyrinth by eating demon feces, which impresses Eris and motivates her to learn division. She provides explicit instructions and advice to Rudeus and Eris during sword practice. She is a good teacher, pointing out faults in explicit detail and giving advice. She identifies Paul as an 'instinctive type' of teacher. She believes that diligent work and talent are important for success, and that mastering the essentials is key to reaching an advanced skill level. She was once an instinctive type but became King-tier by using her head and thinking logically. She attends a staff meeting with Rudeus and Edna. She insists on accompanying Rudeus and Eris to Roa as Eris's bodyguard. She is protective of Eris. She is reliable and has good hearing. She doesn't understand the usefulness of knowing the prices of things. She identifies the floating castle as the Armored Dragon King Perugius's fortress. She attempts to explain Perugius's identity to Rudeus. She has difficulty learning magic and can only perform fire spells. She is standing guard at Eris's birthday party and has drool dripping off her chin. Rudeus sends food to her. She is invited to Rudeus's room after the party. She drinks wine with Rudeus and Eris, ignoring the legal drinking age. She kneels and respectfully accepts a wand from Rudeus, following Sword God Style tradition. She gives Eris a talisman ring passed down in her clan that protects the bearer from being attacked by bad wolves at night. She almost tells a story about Paul. She assists Rudeus in learning the Beast God tongue. She is considered the fourth strongest person in the Sword God Style. She respects Rudeus and sees him as a capable individual. She is impressed by Rudeus's ability to fight and teach. She is learning basic fire and water magic from Rudeus and is now learning to cast spells without chanting. She acknowledges Rudeus's teaching style is similar to her sword master's, which focuses on logical foundations. She believes Rudeus inherited his refusal to quit from his father, Paul. She eventually wants to teach Rudeus a technique to defeat Paul, but Rudeus has no talent for the Sword God Style. She initially underestimated Rudeus, but has come to respect his abilities as a tutor and fighter. She was saved from starvation by Sauros and Eris after being defrauded. She respects Rudeus for his teaching abilities. She believes Paul was good for something because Rudeus gained the ability to move strategically in a swordfight as a result of fighting him. She thinks it is pathetic that Roxy ran from her problems, but is also thankful that she was taught magic by her by proxy. She initially thought Rudeus was a gentleman, but now believes he will become a womanizer. She is ignorant in the affairs of love. She reflects on Eris's growth and attributes it to her desire to impress Rudeus. She had a troublesome childhood herself. She is starting to understand the usefulness of knowing the prices of things. She is helping Eris train in swordplay and believes she could reach Saint-tier. She plans to introduce Eris and Rudeus to her master if Eris continues to improve. She is involved in planning a surprise party for Rudeus's tenth birthday. She is unusually nervous and attempts to keep Rudeus in his room by asking him to demonstrate Saint-tier magic. She is oddly excited about Rudeus's Saint-tier magic. She allows Rudeus to touch her muscular behind to examine the base of her tail. She expresses her desire for a figure that captures her current physique. She claps for Rudeus at his surprise birthday party. She carries Eris to her room after she falls asleep. She is deeply interested in Rudeus's magic. She advises against returning to the city due to the mana concentration. She defends Rudeus from a mysterious attacker, using the Longsword of Light technique. She clashes blades with Arumanfi, revealing his name and allegiance to Perugius. She convinces Arumanfi that they are not responsible for the phenomenon by swearing on her master and household and showing him her sword, Hiramune-Flat Core. She is swallowed by the light as the Fittoa Region vanishes. Her name is listed in the missing persons column. She reappears in the Ejin Forest after being transported by the mana calamity. She is looking for Eris and Rudeus. She enters a berserk state, losing her reason and attacking indiscriminately. She asks Bigott if he has seen Eris or Rudeus. She learns that she is in Markien Mercenary Country and needs to head south to return to Asura. She intends to cut down anyone who gets in her way as she searches for Rudeus and Eris. She kills the Dikuto king. She slices off the head of the Emperor of Broze.",

            "brief_description": "A ten-year-old boy named Rudeus Greyrat, reincarnated from a 34-year-old unemployed virgin. He is working hard to live a proper life, studying magic and swordplay. He is currently in the City of Roa to work for the Young Mistress, and is revealed to be related to the Boreas Greyrat family. He is resourceful, using knowledge from his previous life to solve problems. He is currently Eris's tutor and is teaching her a variety of subjects. He is seeking a grimoire in the library and reflects on the history of magic textbooks. He organizes a staff meeting to discuss Eris's lesson schedule and proposes giving Eris a day off to reduce her stress. He assures Edna that her salary will remain the same despite the adjustment to the lesson schedule. He arranges monthly meetings with Edna and Ghislaine to address any issues regarding Eris's lessons. He plans to visit Roa on his first day off, but Eris and Ghislaine insist on accompanying him due to safety concerns. He reminds Ghislaine that Eris should only call for help within earshot. He compliments Eris's new outfit. He visits the mercantile district of Roa and takes notes on the prices of second-hand wares. He explains to Eris how to calculate profit from reselling. He explains the concept of reselling to the shop owner, who is not pleased. He emphasizes the importance of knowing prices. He is punched by Eris when she laughs at him. He visits a deserted bookstore in the outer part of Roa and takes notes on book titles and prices, recalling that Zenith gave him a similar book on his fifth birthday. He explains to Eris that he earns two silver pieces a month. He explains to Eris the concept of earning money before spending it. He notes down the name of a book he wants to buy. He sees a floating castle in the sky. He learns about Perugius from Eris and Ghislaine and researches him in a book, discovering his connection to the Dragon God Urupen and his role in the battle against Laplace. He learns about Perugius's twelve familiars and his role in sealing away the Demon God Laplace, leading to the start of the Armored Dragon Era. He reflects on Perugius's current status and expresses interest in visiting Chaos Breaker. He is pressured by Eris to take her out again. He acknowledges his lack of talent in swordplay. He observes that Eris and Ghislaine have hit an impasse in their magic lessons. He is unable to help them overcome their difficulties in casting different schools of magic. He decides to continue with basic magic lessons, hoping they will eventually be able to cast without chanting. He observes the bustle in the manor as Eris's tenth birthday approaches. He has free time due to Eris's etiquette lessons. He is attending Eris's birthday party as a house guest. He wants to explore the manor and find someone to help with the preparations. He considers the possibility of cake being served at the birthday party and heads towards the kitchen, hoping to find food samples. He witnesses Eris fleeing from Edna. He agrees to persuade Eris to return to her dance lessons to prevent her from shaming herself at her birthday party. He finds Eris behind the stables and attempts to persuade her to return to her dance lessons. He is kicked off the haystack by Eris. He tries to persuade Eris to give dance practice another chance, emphasizing the feeling of accomplishment from succeeding at something difficult. He accompanies Eris back to her dance lessons. He begins to learn to dance himself and quickly masters some beginner steps. He observes Eris's dancing struggles and attributes them to Edna's ineffective teaching methods and Eris's own fast, sharp movements. He instructs Eris to close her eyes and swing her body to her own rhythm. He uses a method similar to sword training to help Eris dance, clapping his hands in a rhythm for her to match as if dodging attacks. He explains to Edna and Eris that he used a similar approach to teaching Eris to dance as he does with arithmetic and swordplay. He discusses the origins of sword dancing with Edna, suggesting it may come from a desert country or even the Demon Continent. He hunkers down in a corner and observes from there during Eris's birthday party. He dances with Eris at her birthday party, adding feints into their routine. He is complimented by Edna on his performance. He sends food to Ghislaine. He dances with several girls at Eris's party. He learns that Sauros revealed his Greyrat lineage, leading nobles to send their daughters and granddaughters to dance with him. He is advised by Philip to engage with the women freely but is warned against emulating Paul's promiscuity. He dances with Eris to an unfamiliar song, incorporating swordplay-like movements. He is lifted onto Sauros's shoulders after the dance. He invites Ghislaine and Eris to his room after the party. He offers Eris and Ghislaine wine, ignoring the legal drinking age. He gives Eris and Ghislaine wands as birthday gifts. He tries to lighten the mood by presenting the Sylphie figurine to Eris. He stops Ghislaine from telling a story about Paul. He finds Eris sleeping next to him and decides not to disturb her. He explores the manor's tower and finds Sauros with a cat-eared maid. He is invited on a long ride by Sauros. He studies a book about the world's history and learns about the Ancient Age of the Gods and the Dragon God who destroyed the barriers between the worlds. He continues studying world history, learning about the Chaotic Period after the destruction of the barriers between worlds, the development of martial arts and magic, and the First and Second Great Human-Demon Wars. He learns about the Second Great Human-Demon War, the hero Aldebaran splitting the continent, and the subsequent isolation of demons on the Demon Continent. He learns about how the seven heroes convinced the beastfolk to join their side, leading to the sealing of Laplace and the destruction of his companions. He reflects on the significance of the number seven and the classification of various races. He learns about the various languages spoken in the world, named after the gods of the different races, except for the Human tongue. He also notes the regional dialects of the Human tongue and their associated stereotypes. He earns extra money through various side activities. He studies and learns the Beast God tongue with Ghislaine's help and attempts to learn the Demon God tongue. He receives a package from Roxy containing a letter and a thick, untitled book made of animal hide. He reflects on Ghislaine's high ranking in the Sword God Style and the fact that the Roxy figurine he made has found its way to its subject. He is determined to master the textbook on the Demon God tongue that Roxy wrote for him. He surprises Ghislaine with his actions and skills, proving to be more dependable than she initially thought. He patiently teaches Ghislaine arithmetic and magic, adapting his explanations to help her understand. He learns the Beast God tongue and expresses interest in cute girls with cat ears. He is studying the Demon God tongue. Ghislaine suspects he will become a womanizer like his father. He is more mature than Eris in reading, writing, arithmetic, magic, social skills, and conversational prowess. He has dedicated the last two years to language studies and has learned the Beast God, Demon God, and Fighting God tongues. He can speak four languages. He is approaching the Intermediate tier in swordplay. He is improving his magic by making figurines. He is looking forward to learning at the Magic University. He overhears Eris planning a surprise party for him. He is being hidden from the public eye due to his father's past and the paranoia of those in power. He reflects on the customs of nobility and anticipates Eris's disappointment if he doesn't react enthusiastically to her surprise party. He practices making fake tears with water magic. He is aware of Ghislaine's nervousness and desire to keep him in his room. He teases Ghislaine by suggesting they go demonstrate Saint-tier magic and presents her with a work-in-progress figurine of herself. He examines Ghislaine's muscular behind to get a better understanding of the base of her tail. He attends his surprise birthday party and acts surprised and grateful, even shedding fake tears to show his appreciation. His overly enthusiastic acting causes Eris, Philip, and Sauros to overreact. He embraces Eris and whispers words of gratitude in her ear. He guesses that his father is the surprise, but he is incorrect. He is embraced by Hilda. He is told he is part of the Greyrat family and is encouraged to marry Eris. He is presented with an expensive staff by Eris. He examines the staff, noting the affinity between wood and magic types, and the importance of the crystal's size, transparency, and color for amplifying magic. He is given the staff Aqua Heartia as a gift from Eris and the Greyrat family. He listens to Philip explain the Boreas family's tradition of taking sons to the imperial capital. He is told by Philip that Hilda hated him because her sons were taken away while Rudeus was allowed to stay. Philip expresses hope in Rudeus's abilities and suggests he could help overthrow James. He learns that Paul cried to Philip because he was going to get married but didn‚Äôt have the money to afford a place and needed a stable job. He is tempted by Eris's offer to do 'just a little' and decides to accept it, sitting next to her on the bed. He kisses Eris on the cheek, touches her breasts, and reaches for her thigh, misinterpreting her consent. He is slapped and kicked by Eris. He reflects on his actions, realizing he misread the situation and acted impulsively, driven by lust. He recognizes the potential consequences of his actions and fears becoming entangled in the Boreas family's power struggles. He decides to leave the Boreas household and die on the roadside. He apologizes to Eris for his actions. He is forgiven by Eris, who sets a five-year waiting period. He vows to be a gentleman until then, but accidentally 'releases the A button' the next morning. He asks the maid to keep quiet about his 'accident'. Roxy wonders if he is involved in the strange magical phenomenon she is observing. He is under the protection of the Boreas family. He prepares to demonstrate Saint-tier water magic to Ghislaine and Eris but is interrupted by the strange phenomenon in the sky. He tests his new staff, Aqua Heartia, and discovers it amplifies his magic significantly, especially water magic. He is attacked by a mysterious man wearing a yellow mask and is defended by Ghislaine. He recognizes Arumanfi as one of Perugius's twelve familiars and warns Ghislaine about his ability to move at the speed of light. He retreats with Eris to a safe distance. He is thought to be the cause of the strange phenomenon in the sky by Arumanfi. He attempts to speak with Arumanfi when a beam of light from the sky engulfs the Fittoa Region. He shields Eris as the region vanishes. Roxy hopes that he used his quick wits to survive. His name is listed in the missing persons column. He is adaptable and resourceful.",

            "brief_description": "Philip Boreas Greyrat's daughter and Rudeus's student. She is arrogant, fierce, proud, has a fiery temper, is physically violent, prone to vengeful behavior, and does not listen to others. She is skilled at rendering her opponents powerless. She is currently being tutored by Rudeus in a variety of subjects. She is motivated to improve and aims to be as good as Ghislaine and Rudeus. She is becoming violent again due to the lack of breaks in her schedule. She is irritable during arithmetic lessons. She is being taught to perform mental arithmetic by Rudeus. She insists on accompanying Rudeus to Roa, believing she can escape kidnapping on her own. She is curious about Rudeus's plans for his day off. She wears a new outfit and punches Rudeus when he compliments her. She struggles with calculating profit during reselling but eventually grasps the concept, albeit with errors. She doesn't understand the usefulness of knowing the prices of things. She laughs at Rudeus when Rudeus suggests that knowing prices is useless. She offers to buy Rudeus a book but is reminded that she has no money. She is lectured by Rudeus on the importance of earning money before spending it. She briefly understands the lecture and shows a rare look of utter defeat. She proudly explains Perugius's history as one of the three legendary heroes who defeated the Demon God Laplace. She demands to be taken out again, displaying a mix of emotions. She is becoming more perceptive of Rudeus's teaching methods. She is adept at reading and writing, but struggles with arithmetic. She has mastered most basic magic spells except earth. She has reached Intermediate-tier in Sword God Style and is approaching her tenth birthday, which is being celebrated with a large party. She is taking special etiquette lessons to avoid shaming herself at her birthday party. She is currently fleeing from Edna because she struggles with dancing lessons. She is at risk of shaming herself at her birthday party. She is lying on a pile of hay behind the stables. She kicks Rudeus off the haystack and rests her heel on his head. She expresses her dislike for dancing and declares that she won't dance at her birthday either. She is eventually motivated to return to her dance lessons and asks Rudeus to accompany her. She sulks when Edna compliments Rudeus. Her personality and movements are well suited to the Sword God Style, but they are a drawback when it comes to dancing. Her steps are too fast and too sharp. Her rhythm and instinctively dislikes being interrupted. She is doubtful when Rudeus asks her to close her eyes and swing her body to her own rhythm. She is able to dance to the rhythm when Rudeus claps his hands to mimic dodging attacks. She nods and remains silent with her eyes wide open when Rudeus explains that he used a similar approach to teaching her to dance as he does with arithmetic and swordplay. She proudly praises Rudeus. She is dolled up and seated like a princess at her birthday party. She turns into a robot that parrots the words, \"Please tell my father,\" whenever anything is brought up. She dances with Rudeus at her birthday party and steps on his foot a few times. She approaches Rudeus for a dance, wearing a blue dress. She is wearing an up-do with a floral ornament and looks lovely. She seems excited and is the star of her birthday party. She dances with Rudeus to an unfamiliar song, incorporating swordplay-like movements. She is laughing like a girl her age should. She is excited and nervous during her party. She drinks wine with Rudeus and Ghislaine, ignoring the legal drinking age. She prefers Rudeus's miniature replicas to the wand he gives her. She is happy to receive a talisman ring from Ghislaine. She sleeps next to Rudeus, hugging the wand and wearing the talisman ring. She is better behaved after her tenth birthday, takes her lessons seriously, and punches Rudeus less frequently. She is the imagined version of the Great Emperor of the Demon World, Kishirika, in Rudeus's mind. She helped save Ghislaine from starvation. She is developing feelings for Rudeus. She has grown a lot in the past two years and has stopped yelling and sullying her clothes. She wants to look good in front of Rudeus. She stayed the night in Rudeus's room. She is devoting herself to sword practice, possibly feeling pressure from Rudeus's maturity and skills. She asks Ghislaine to accompany her in sword practice. She is improving her writing skills and is able to imitate ladylike manners. She is now at Advanced-tier in swordplay. She is planning a surprise party for Rudeus's tenth birthday. She went to her grandfather for the first time in a long while to request a secret party for Rudeus. She wears a bright red dress and has a large bouquet of flowers in her arms at Rudeus's surprise birthday party. She is gobsmacked by Rudeus's acting. She presents Rudeus with an expensive staff as a gift and looks to her father for backup. She reveals that Paul and Zenith couldn't come to the party. She is surprised when her mother suggests that Rudeus marry her. She is told to refine herself as a lady. She asks Alphonse to explain the staff's origins to Rudeus. She presents Rudeus with the Aqua Heartia staff. She becomes exhausted and falls asleep, and Ghislaine carries her to her room. She is wearing a red negligee and claims she came to sleep with Rudeus because he might be lonely. She offers Rudeus to do 'just a little'. She allows Rudeus to kiss her cheek and touch her breasts, but shoves him away and slaps him when he reaches for her thigh. She attacks Rudeus after he misinterprets her offer, leaving the door open as she storms out. She peeks in on Rudeus and forgives him, but sets a five-year waiting period for anything more. She is sometimes violent, sometimes meek, depending on the situation. She listens properly. She is almost perfect in reading and writing. She is capable of doing division. She can't do any spells without chanting them, and Intermediate-tier spells are also a challenge. She is studying difficult imperial court etiquette. She loves Rudeus. She was an uncontainable wild animal three years ago, but has recently become more refined. She is nervous and excited when Rudeus prepares to demonstrate his magic. She notices the mana in the sky. She retreats with Rudeus to a safe distance. She freezes in confusion as a beam of light engulfs the Fittoa Region. Rudeus wraps his body around her to shield her as the region vanishes. Her name is listed in the missing persons column.",

He is also the town's mayor. He prioritizes the Greyrat family's image and political standing. He is married to Hilda. He encourages Rudeus to peruse the library. He teaches Eris history in his free time. He told Eris that Rudeus likes books. He directs a butler to retrieve a book for Rudeus. He requested that Eris act like a ten-year-old child without causing any shame to herself at her birthday party. He and his wife deftly handle the poorer and lesser nobles that swarm around the family at Eris's birthday party. He explains that Sauros revealed Rudeus's Greyrat lineage. He advises Rudeus to engage with the women freely but warns him against emulating Paul's promiscuity. He attempts to restrain Sauros from starting a war against the Notos family. He escorts Hilda away from the scene with glacial composure. He watches over the party with a smile. He reveals to Rudeus that Eris has older and younger brothers who were taken by his elder brother as adopted sons according to the Boreas family tradition. He lost the battle to become the head of the family to James, and still hopes to overthrow him. He recognizes Rudeus's acting and abilities. He admits he hired Ghislaine to teach Eris swordplay because he thought she was hopeless as a noble. He offers Rudeus the opportunity to marry Eris and help him seize control of the Boreas family. He claims he has no responsibility for Eris and would prefer to hand her over to Rudeus.",

He saved Ghislaine from starvation after she was defrauded. He threatens war against the Notos family to install Rudeus as the head of the family.

She has the face of a middle-aged woman whose wrinkles are just beginning to show. Her features are soft, and she has a kind smile that emanates warmth. She attends a staff meeting with Rudeus and Ghislaine. She is concerned that her salary will be reduced if her lessons are reduced, but Rudeus assures her that it will not be. She agrees to monthly meetings with Rudeus to address any issues regarding Eris's lessons. She looks exhausted and has requested a drastic increase in the number of etiquette lessons with Eris. She is chasing after Eris. She is troubled that Eris keeps running away from her dance lessons. She asks Rudeus to persuade Eris to return to her dance lessons to prevent her from shaming herself at her birthday party. Her teaching methods are ineffective. Her method of teaching is to say, \"Do it this way,\" \"Do it that way,\" and \"Just memorize what I‚Äôm telling you.\" She never touches on why those things are necessary. Her gentle smile wavers when Rudeus asks Eris to close her eyes and swing her body to her own rhythm. She is amazed that Eris is able to dance to the rhythm and yells, \"You did it! You did it, Young Mistress!\". She seems thoroughly impressed with Rudeus's teaching abilities and attributes it to his vast knowledge. She discusses the origins of sword dancing with Rudeus. She calls out, \"You did well, Lord Rudeus,\" after Rudeus and Eris finish their dance. She is amazed that Rudeus calmed Eris's nerves.",

      PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
      I mean, what are you planning to do?‚Äù ‚ÄúAnyone who gets in my way gets cut down. That‚Äôs all.‚Äù There was a ferocity in her eyes that made him doubt if she was still in possession of reason. Bigott had no words. Just what had her so stirred up? ‚ÄúHopefully Rudeus is with Lady Eris, but there‚Äôs a chance they were both transported somewhere else just like I was. I have to hurry.‚Äù After hearing that, he understood. We‚Äôre not that different, he thought. Those two children, particularly the red-haired girl, were 234 | P a g e more important than anything to the Sword King. She was desperate to protect that which was precious to her. ‚ÄúIn that case, why don‚Äôt we travel part of the way together? We also have something to take care of in that direction.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù For some reason Bigott felt particularly proud. Although their objectives differed, he felt like he was standing side-by-side with this Sword King, fighting for something he wanted to protect. Bigott, his men, and Ghislaine slipped out from the forest and attacked the Dikuto Kingdom from behind. Their luck was good. As soon as the battle with Markien began, all the troops were focused on what was in front of them. The Broze Emperor found it suspicious that his bodyguards had failed to return. He suspected the Dikuto Kingdom was planning an ambush for his troops, and that his bodyguards had been killed after discovering their plot. After all, the Dikuto king‚Äôs main army was close to the forest. It seemed likely they had troops hiding further within. In truth, the Dikuto king was a coward and had camped with his back to the forest so he wouldn‚Äôt be caught in a surprise attack by the Broze Empire. The combination of these factors would later lead to Bigott‚Äôs success. Ghislaine howled and Bigott let out a fierce cry as he led his men into battle. They charged right into the enemy camp where the Dikuto king‚Äôs tent was set up. The king was startled by their surprise attack. Seeing their armor, he immediately thought the Broze Emperor had launched a sneak attack from the forest. He hailed a nearby attendant and commanded an assault on the Broze Empire. Then he tried to take shelter from the chaos.
235 | P a g e It was only ten seconds later when Ghislaine tore the Dikuto king asunder with her blade, killing him. If he had lived, he might have realized Bigott and his men were not of the Broze Empire and retracted his orders, but an imperial edict had absolute power. The Dikuto Kingdom surged into battle against the Broze Empire. The Broze Empire had predicted such an attack would come, so while they were caught off guard by its timing, they were able to put up a fight. That was when the Markien Mercenary Country took up arms. It was a three-pronged free-for-all. Bigott found himself surrounded by enemies, but he was still alive. It was his mission to die deceiving the Dikuto Kingdom into thinking his attack was the work of the Broze Empire, yet still he clung to life. He and his men had already been separated, and the only ally close to him was a single fighter. There, right in front of him. He followed in the shadow of her tanned back as the light of her sword flashed, cutting through the enemy. He had never seen such a reliable figure before. He felt so proud to be protecting her flank. At last they could no longer see the armor of the Dikuto Kingdom around them. Instead, they were surrounded by soldiers of the Broze Empire. While the Empire was surprised by the intrusion of a woman with a blood-red blade, they had watched her cut down the Dikuto Kingdom‚Äôs men and noticed Bigott protecting her flank in his Broze armor. They mistook Bigott and Ghislaine for allies. That was when Markien surged in. The two allied countries were shaken as the battle started up behind them. Not only had their bond alliance broken, but their formations as well. Markien, which should have been at a disadvantage, broke through their front lines. A chaotic battle ensued. Amidst the violent fighting, Bigott became separated from Ghislaine, but managed to rejoin his comrades. Shouts of joy rang out from the Markien mercenaries as 236 | P a g e they recognized Bigott and took up a firm position around him. Instead of falling back, Bigott remained on the front lines and kept fighting. The battle raged on, the soldiers covered in mud and blood, not fully aware of what was happening around them.
Bigott took an arrow in his left eye. Anguished, he searched for the bowman responsible. That was when he saw it. He watched as it happened. Below an eye-catching banner, dressed in luxurious Broze armor, was a man with a black beard. Bigott saw the flash of red as that man, the Emperor of Broze, had his head sliced off by a brown-skinned woman. ‚ÄúHa, hah, hahaha!‚Äù He laughed, and as he laughed, the battle wore on. And he lived. The final battle ended in victory for the Markien Mercenary Country. *** Thanks to his achievements, Bigott Mercenal earned the position of general. He was celebrated as a legendary hero for having succeeded in a suicide mission and for executing Dikuto‚Äôs king. After that, Bigott Mercenal continued to do spectacular work that resulted in him being known as one of the most outstanding Great Generals of the Markien Mercenary Country. That, however, is a story for another time. Once that decisive battle was over, the Great General Bigott started doing something strange. He started wearing a necklace that had the profile of a female beastfolk chiseled into it, and began painting the blade of his sword red. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good luck charm.‚Äù 237 | P a g e His men began to imitate him, and those who heard their tales followed suit. These customs continued spreading until they took their modern-day shape. When asked what kind of good luck charm it was, Bigott responded thus: ‚ÄúI was helped by a goddess during that battle. I‚Äôm following her example.‚Äù It was from his words that the Forest Goddess Laine was created. The name Ghislaine was difficult for those in the southern part of the Central Continent to pronounce, and so her name, altered by their accents, became Laine. She appeared from the forest, rescuing the life of the great general, becoming the Goddess of Salvation. Forest Goddess Laine. For the next hundred years she was worshipped as Markien‚Äôs Goddess of Protection, providing support to the hearts of many soldiers. Of course, the real Ghislaine had no knowledge of this designation. Where did Ghislaine go after that? Was she still alive? Did she survive that battle and go on home to Asura Kingdom? Was she able to meet that precious Young Mistress of hers again? Bigott Mercenal had no way of knowing.

            "brief_description": "A petite, plain, and gloomy commoner student who transferred to Minerva's. Initially perceived as mute, she is quiet and reserved due to a period of isolation, which has affected her speech and makes her anxious about public speaking. She is rescued by Bernie from bullies and helped with her studies. She claims not to be afraid of spiders and is grateful for Bernie's help. She is bullied by her classmates, who cut her hair and steal her possessions. Her understanding of magic formulae is exceptional, and she demonstrates unchanted magecraft, marking her as a true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is selected as one of the Seven Sages. Despite her accomplishments, she remains shy and insecure, and is hurt by Bernie's cruel rejection. She is now attending Serendia Academy and is part of the student council, taking horseback-riding class to guard Prince Felix. She is extremely shy, clumsy, and has awful balance, which makes horseback riding difficult for her. She hates being in front of others, which led her to isolate herself for magecraft research. She isn't scared of horses, but is scared of falling from high places and is more scared of people. She chose horseback riding as an elective despite her poor ballroom dancing grades. She wants to learn horseback riding to tell Casey, her friend, one day. She is confused by Felix's actions and notices his knowledge of magecraft. She is familiar with magic battles from her time at Minerva's and recalls her fear during the Seven Sages qualifiers. She is aware of the failed assassination attempt on Felix by Casey. She feels guilty about her inability to reveal Casey's involvement in the lumber incident and appreciates the kindness of Cyril, Lana, Neil, and Isabelle. She chose chess as her second elective and has studied the textbook in advance. She is invited to chess class by Elliott, but feels awkward due to their social differences. She is questioned by Elliott about why she didn't call him out for using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She doesn't mind being looked down upon and blames herself for not learning the chess rules. She is confused by Elliott's behavior and expresses her desire to simply play chess. She played Elliott to a stalemate. Her chess playing style is thoroughly logical, never wasting a move for a slight advantage. She is warned by Elliot that talented commoners are often envied or exploited, causing her anxiety. She is chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which causes her to panic. She recalls her selection for the Seven Sages qualifiers at Minerva's, orchestrated by Professor Rutherford, and the pressure she felt. She reflects on wanting to share the news with her foster mother and a close friend who taught her unchanted magecraft. She is currently using the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. She is gloomy about reporting her selection for the chess competition to Felix. She volunteers to bring her student council work back to her dorm, but is overruled by Cyril and Elliott. She has been borrowing chess books from the library and eating into her sleep time to read them. She has been having bouts of insomnia after the incident with Casey, and she‚Äôs been holing herself away in her attic room, using chess to distract herself. She doesn‚Äôt own a chessboard, so she‚Äôd drawn squares on a piece of paper and used scraps of wood and small pebbles as the pieces. She‚Äôd play chess with herself, and before she knew it, morning would come. She is eager to win a chess game against Felix in order to ask him for a wish. She defeats Felix in chess with a merciless attack. She asks Felix to stop calling her \"little squirrel,\" but does not specify what she wants to be called instead, leading to further teasing. She is asked by Benjamin and Elliott to be the anchor of the chess team. She is terrified of being the anchor due to past experiences with public speaking and hyperventilation. She learns that Neil Maywood was the anchor of the chess team the previous year, which surprises her. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own. She reveals to Lana that she is participating in the chess competition and is relieved by Lana's positive reaction. She realizes that the chess competition will be against the University and Minerva's, her former school, causing her to panic. She is overwhelmed by the thought of facing people from her past at Minerva's, causing her to hyperventilate and recall hurtful words from Bernie. She promises Lana to visit her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles to sleep due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's and is haunted by memories of Bernie's hurtful words. She finds Nero and Ryn playing a stacking game with chess pieces in her room. She learns that Casey has been sent to a convent in the north after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot against Felix. She reflects on Casey's motives and the potential for Duke Clockford to instigate a war with Landor and the Empire. She decides to face political realities to protect Felix, acknowledging his kindness but questioning his true intentions and whether he is a pawn of Duke Clockford. She resolves to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She instructs Nero and Ryn to monitor for suspicious mana and conversations near Felix. She is speechless at Ryn's proposal of a love triangle. She realizes that Nero and Ryn's adult appearances in school uniforms will attract attention. She visits Lana, who dresses her in a corset and offers to do her makeup for the upcoming chess competition. She receives a makeover from Lana for the chess competition, including light makeup, a slight slant to her bangs, and glasses. She is amazed by her healthy and mature appearance. She is about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is told by Elliott that she looks like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her new look, which pleases her greatly. She is wearing false glasses as a disguise. She believes that wearing glasses makes her look good at chess and is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like an advanced course student. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and is anxious about encountering him at the competition. She sees Bernie Jones among the Minerva's representatives and panics, recalling their last encounter. She focuses on maintaining her composure during the greetings with the University and Minerva's students. She formally greets Bernie Jones as Monica Norton, relying on Lana's makeup and posture advice to maintain her disguise. She freezes under pressure when Mr. Redding questions her skills, and mentally calculates the value of pi to cope with anxiety. She reflects on the importance of appearance as a weapon in society. She fixes her glasses and encourages herself to do her best. She encounters Bernie, who notes her resemblance to someone he knew with the same first name. She feels conflicted about wanting to be Bernie's friend despite his past actions. She is rescued from Bernie by Nero and Ryn, who claim her as their woman. She collapses from exhaustion after the encounter with Bernie. She is embarrassed by Nero and Ryn's disguises and asks them to transform back into a cat and bird. She is taking her seat at the chess competition and is anxious about Bernie discovering her identity and whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch. She chokes when trying to wish Robert Winkel a good game. She initially stumbles over her words, but regains her composure and focuses on the game. She is playing chess very quickly, making moves in three seconds or less. She moves her knight and sighs. She wins her chess match against Robert Winkel with checkmate in a shockingly short amount of time. She attends a mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is approached by Elliott and Benjamin, who accuse her of holding back during their practice games. She is hiding behind Elliott and Benjamin because she is scared of Robert Winkel. She stares blankly at Robert Winkel's marriage proposal, not understanding the situation. She is the object of Robert Winkel's affections because of her chess skills. She is being pursued by Robert Winkel for marriage, but declines his proposal. She is impressed by Robert's logical reasoning for wanting to marry her. She is attacked by Bernie, who reveals that he knows she is one of the Seven Sages. She is verbally attacked by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity and manipulating others. She is deeply hurt by Bernie's insults and struggles to defend herself. She realizes that Bernie hates her and is defended by Lana. She is reminded by Bernie that she is hiding her identity as one of the Seven Sages and that she is lying to Lana. She defends Lana against Bernie's insults, stating that she will no longer tolerate his behavior. She reveals her past desire to gain his approval and be a friend he could be proud of, but declares that she is done seeking his praise. She then turns her back on Bernie and walks away with Lana. She expresses her newfound strength and gratitude to Lana, attributing it to the corset and makeup. She is playing against Bernie in the chess competition. She returns to the competition room and finds Robert Winkel being punished by Felix and Cyril for his continued pursuit of her. She is frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel's punishment. She is surprised but not disturbed by Bernie's change of position in the chess match. She is calm and focused on the game, no longer seeking Bernie's approval. She is playing aggressively and destroying Bernie's plans. She defeats Bernie in chess with checkmate and shows no emotion towards him. She is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman and trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free from the water sphere using unchanted magecraft and defeats the fake Mr. Pitman with a mana-infused wind bullet. She thanks Ryn for telling her that Bernie was in danger. She asks Ryn to have Nero guard Felix. She believes that her fake life at the academy is over.",

            "brief_description": "The second son of Count Ambard, a noble in the Kingdom of Ridill. He is highly intelligent, ambitious, and skilled in magic, especially quick-chanting. Enrolling in Minerva's at age ten, his goal is to become one of the Seven Sages. He is protective of Monica, helping her with her studies and deciding to teach her quick-chanting to help her overcome her fear of public speaking, though he is aware of the bullying she endures but allows it to continue to ensure her dependence on him. He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but is now envious and feels betrayed by her unchanted magecraft, leading him to train recklessly and develop mana poisoning. He resents Monica's success and selection as one of the Seven Sages, and cruelly dismisses her attempts to thank him, reveling in her distress. He finds peace in the rumor that she is living as a hermit. Monica recalls his scornful eyes and hurtful words, blaming herself for their broken friendship. He introduced Monica to chess, but scorned it as a mere idle amusement. He is a representative from Minerva's in the chess competition. He is the son of Count Ambard and is representing Minerva's in the chess competition. He is politely cordial to Monica Norton, unaware that she is Monica Everett. He notes Monica Norton's resemblance to someone he used to know, who shares the same first name. He demands an answer from Monica Norton when she hesitates to answer his questions. He is intimidated by Nero and Ryn and apologizes for bothering Monica Norton before leaving. He is listening intently to the conversation between the teachers and is staring hard at Monica. He is glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is eating lunch and chatting cheerfully with the other students from Minerva's. Monica is trying to keep her distance from him. He attacks Monica with fire magic and reveals that he knows she is one of the Seven Sages. He confronts Monica, accusing her of hiding her identity and manipulating others. He insults her appearance and actions, causing her distress. He grabs Monica's hair and makes cruel remarks about her. He is confronted by Lana for cornering Monica in the hallway and making her cry. He is revealed to hate Monica. He accuses Monica of pretending to be helpless to take advantage of other people and claims that she is hiding her true identity and sponging off everyone else. He is revealed to be jealous of Monica. He is taken aback when Monica lashes out at him. He is left speechless when Monica declares that she is done trying to get his praise. He is determined to keep Monica thinking about him and seeks out Mr. Pitman to change the chess match order. He pressures Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to change the chess match order. He obtains Mr. Macragan's signature to change the chess match order so he can play against Monica. He is changing places with Elliott to play against Monica. He is determined to win against Monica at all costs, even if it means sacrificing pieces. He is defeated by Monica in chess. He is rude and unrefined, unworthy of a son of Count Ambard. He is frustrated and angry after losing to Monica. He is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman, who is an imperial mage in disguise. He is saved by Monica. He attacks the fake Mr. Pitman with lightning arrows, but the mage deflects them. He is grabbed by the mage and unable to chant. He is rescued by Monica.

            "brief_description": "A student council secretary who is a stickler for social hierarchy and dislikes Monica for being a commoner in the council. He invites Monica to chess class but she feels awkward due to their social differences. He questions Monica about why she didn't call him out for using castling without explaining it during their previous match, indicating a possible internal conflict or sense of guilt. He admits he didn't explain castling because he was being cocky and trying to win easily. He recalls his childhood resentment towards Felix due to his clumsiness and perceived incompetence. As a child, he teased Felix and caused him to fall from a tree, resulting in an injury and a scar. He initially felt guilty but was covered for by Felix. He is beginning to understand Felix's affinity for Monica. His chess playing style focuses too much on each piece‚Äôs prescribed role, giving higher-ranking pieces a greater role in his strategy. He reveals that his uncle committed suicide after being betrayed by his commoner wife, reinforcing his prejudice against commoners who act above their station. He warns Monica that talented commoners are often envied or exploited. He is chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on the chess competition rather than her council work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess and studying until he fainted. He describes Monica as a total beast at chess. He realizes Monica held back in their chess game and pinches her cheeks as punishment. He threatens to tell on her and have her position switched. He agrees with Benjamin that Monica should be the anchor of the chess team. He reluctantly agrees to remain the anchor after Monica's desperate pleas. He reveals that Officer Maywood was the anchor of the chess team the previous year. He remarks that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course. He attempts to lighten the mood when Monica freezes under pressure during the pre-competition greetings. He is the glue holding the chess team together. He lost his chess match against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice games. He is surprised by Robert Winkel's marriage proposal to Monica. He believes Monica is being too honest. He warns Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel being punished. He is insulted by Bernie switching places with him to play against Monica.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        Nevertheless, he racked his brain, using all his knowledge to try and pin down what, exactly, he was seeing. It had very obviously induced a physical transformation. Magecraft that strengthened or changed the body was called body-manipulation magecraft. Because of its high risk of mana contamination, it was forbidden throughout the world. In recent years, however, one nation had reopened research on the topic. That nation was the empire to the east of the Kingdom of Ridill. ‚ÄúAre you from the Schwargald Empire?‚Äù demanded Bernie. The fake Pitman smiled without answering. If a mage from the Empire had swapped places with Pitman and infiltrated Serendia Academy, he was likely here to either assassinate or kidnap someone important. And the only person who fit that profile‚Äîwho was guaranteed to appear at the chess competition‚Äîwas‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs after Prince Felix! Bernie couldn‚Äôt overlook an intruder bent on harming the second prince. He had to stop this imperial mage‚Äôs scheme, whatever it took. Bernie began to chant, intending to use the most powerful spell in his arsenal, but the imperial mage launched into a sliding dash. He was fast. The man‚Äôs impossibly strong legs propelled him over to Bernie in the blink of an eye. He grabbed the boy‚Äôs neck with one hand, easily lifting him into the air. ‚ÄúGah‚Ä¶hah!‚Äù The false Pitman was a slender man of middling height‚ÄîBernie couldn‚Äôt imagine he had the strength to lift a person with only one hand. But the structure of the hand around Bernie‚Äôs neck was warped. His nails were longer, sharper. The arm itself rippled with unnatural muscle. Apparently, his skin wasn‚Äôt the only thing that had changed. Scales that could block magical attacks, combined with Herculean strength‚Ä¶ I see, thought Bernie. Dragonshifting indeed. He flailed his legs and dug his nails into the arm gripping his neck, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. And worst of all, he couldn‚Äôt chant in this situation. He had to at least warn someone. The Eugene Pitman at Serendia was an imperial mage in disguise, using dangerous body-manipulation magecraft! ‚ÄúBernie?!‚Äù Suddenly, he heard a voice from behind him. He looked around using only his eyes to find Monica standing in the doorway. The imperial mage swore, then began quick-chanting a spell. ‚ÄúDrown and die!‚Äù Immediately, the ground at Monica‚Äôs feet began to glow. Then a sphere of water appeared, enclosing her.
Trapped by the bubble, Monica‚Äôs face warped in pain. Her mouth opened and closed pointlessly. The imperial mage sighed, irritated by the string of interruptions. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have you screaming, you see. I‚Äôm sorry, young lady, but I need you to stay in there until you drown.‚Äù Monica struggled inside the sphere of water, bubbles spurting from her mouth. The sphere used a type of powerful internal barrier, and it was very difficult to escape once inside it. Even mages, unable to chant underwater, would have no choice but to wait for death. Mages who needed to chant, that is. There was a high-pitched noise like the sound of glass breaking. The imperial mage, confused, turned around‚Äîbut by then, the watery barrier enclosing Monica was already covered in cracks, letting the water drain out. ‚ÄúImpossible!‚Äù exclaimed the fake Pitman as the barrier completely burst, spraying water everywhere and releasing Monica to the floor. The girl coughed and coughed but managed to look up and face the imperial mage squarely. Behind her wet, messy bangs, her light-brown eyes glowed with just a hint of green. Wind created from mana blustered up around her. That wind then formed an invisible bullet that proceeded to strike the imperial mage right between his eyes. ‚ÄúGahhh, agh?!‚Äù The one weakness of dragons, which were otherwise highly resistant to magecraft, was the spot between their eyes‚Äîand apparently, the same rule applied to those using dragonshifting magecraft. The blow to his brow concussed the imperial mage. His eyes rolled up, and he fell over backward. Bernie, his neck freed from the mage‚Äôs grasp, fell to the floor, gasping for air. ‚ÄúBernie‚Ä¶ A-are you all right?!‚Äù He looked up to see Monica staring down at him, worry on her face. He sat and fixed his crooked glasses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. More importantly, do you have any idea what‚Äôs going on‚Äî?‚Äù Before he could finish, he heard a tapping noise at the window. He looked over to see a small yellow bird perched outside the glass. Monica ran over and opened the window, letting the bird fly into the room. A moment later, it transformed into a person. This person was someone Bernie recognized. It was the blond man with the far-too-formal clothes. Apparently, he hadn‚Äôt been a man at all but a spirit.
‚ÄúYou have dealt with the assassin wonderfully, Silent Witch.‚Äù ‚ÄúMiss Ryn, thank you for telling me that Bernie was in danger.‚Äù Monica bowed to the blond spirit, then looked down at the imperial mage. ‚ÄúThis person may have been a decoy, so please continue to remain alert. And can you ask Nero to stay near the prince at all times, too?‚Äù ‚ÄúAt once.‚Äù After hearing Monica talk to the spirit, Bernie finally understood why she was here. She was an extremely shy person. She never would have enrolled in Serendia Academy of her own volition. He surmised she was on a mission to protect the second prince‚Äîa top secret one, no doubt. A mission that had demanded she enroll here. Monica wrung out her dripping wet skirt, then picked her glasses off the floor and put them in her pocket. The soaking wet girl with disheveled hair reminded him a lot of Everett the Mute back at Minerva‚Äôs, when her classmates had bullied her. She‚Äôd been sniffling and sobbing back then. But she was different now. Without shedding a single tear, she looked at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he replied gruffly. Monica smiled, a tinge of loneliness to her expression. ‚ÄúIt looks like‚Ä¶this is the end of my fake life at the academy.‚Äù This attempted assassination would probably blow up into a huge incident. The real Eugene Pitman had probably been killed when the imperial mage took his place. With a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs as the victim, it would be impossible to cover up. Monica‚Äôs identity as the one who had captured him would soon be known far and wide, forcing her to leave the academy. Bernie could hear footsteps in the distance‚Äîprobably someone coming to check the waiting room. Ugh, fine! Without taking the time to think it over, Bernie called out. ‚ÄúHave that spirit turn back into a bird. Quickly!‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh? Um, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù As Monica stood there at a loss, not understanding his instruction, the spirit quickly returned to bird form. Bernie then hid the bird behind a shelf. Just as he finished, two people entered the waiting room. They were both members of the academy‚Äôs student council‚ÄîCyril Ashley and Neil Clay Maywood. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this?!‚Äù demanded Cyril. ‚ÄúOh no, oh no! Are you okay, Lady Norton?! You‚Äôre soaking wet!‚Äù cried Neil. The room was a mess.

        That final game would end soon, but Lana was much more concerned about Monica than the chess. After losing to her friend, Bernie Jones had run out of the room. Eventually, Monica had quietly left as well‚Äîprobably to go after him. Lana was worried that Bernie might take his anger out on her or say terrible things to her again. She knew Cyril and Neil had gone to check the waiting room, so she doubted much would happen, but she couldn‚Äôt shake the bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. Eventually, Neil returned. Instead of going back to his seat, though, he quickly walked over to Felix and whispered something in his ear. Is Vice President Ashley not with him? wondered Lana. The fact that Cyril wasn‚Äôt here and the grim expression on Neil‚Äôs face stirred her anxiety even more. Just then, the third match ended. Elliott Howard had won, meaning so had Serendia, with two victories and one defeat. A short break would follow, after which the University would play against Minerva‚Äôs. But just then, Felix stood up and made an announcement. ‚ÄúI apologize for the sudden interruption so soon after the end of the match. However, there‚Äôs something I need everyone to hear.‚Äù His usual smile was gone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve received word of an intruder in the academy.‚Äù Lana was stunned speechless. Everyone else was just as surprised‚Äîand they all looked uneasy. To calm them down, Felix softened his tone a little bit. ‚ÄúThere is no need for alarm. The intruder has already been captured, and security guards are on standby outside this room. But just to be sure, I‚Äôd like to have them patrol the campus, so would everyone please stay here for the time being?‚Äù The room erupted into chatter, but nobody panicked‚Äîthe prince had said there were security guards just outside the door, after all. Wait a minute, thought Lana. What about Monica? She‚Äôs not here. What happened to her? Just as she was about to ask, someone quietly came over to where she was seated‚ÄîNeil. ‚ÄúDo you have a moment?‚Äù he asked, beckoning to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn before lowering his voice and whispering, ‚ÄúLady Norton was at the scene of the intruder‚Äôs capture.‚Äù He then covered Glenn‚Äôs mouth just before the other boy shouted in surprise. It seemed he was becoming quite good at handling him. ‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù he continued.
‚ÄúFortunately, she isn‚Äôt injured, but she‚Äôs probably experiencing some shock‚Ä¶ Would you all go and be with her?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is she now?‚Äù asked Lana immediately. Neil spoke softly so that nobody else would hear. ‚ÄúThe infirmary.‚Äù And so Lana, Claudia, and Glenn snuck out of the room at Neil‚Äôs request and headed for the infirmary with security guards to escort them. ‚ÄúMonica, are you in there? We‚Äôre coming in, okay?‚Äù When they knocked on the infirmary door and peered inside, in place of the resident nurse, they found Monica sitting patiently in a chair‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶wearing nothing but a man‚Äôs jacket over her underwear. Lana wasted no time tackling Glenn and pushing him out of the room, leaving only her and Claudia inside, before shoving the door closed. ‚ÄúWhat was that for?!‚Äù the boy shouted from the hallway, but he wasn‚Äôt important right now. Monica didn‚Äôt seem particularly fazed by Glenn seeing her in her underwear. ‚ÄúOh, hi, Lana,‚Äù she said, remaining seated as she calmly looked up at her. Lana strode over to her friend and asked, her voice shaking, ‚ÄúWhose jacket is that?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril let me borrow it‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana buried her face in her hands and lifted her head toward the ceiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always thought better of Vice President Ashley!‚Äù ‚ÄúL-Lana‚Ä¶?‚Äù stammered Monica. ‚ÄúAnd how could he leave a girl here in a state like this?!‚Äù wailed Lana. Monica lowered her gaze, unsure of what to do. The only calm one in the room, Claudia glanced at Monica‚Äôs dripping wet uniform hanging in the corner and murmured, ‚ÄúThat idiot‚Äôs not the type. I doubt he has the guts.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt that the only assumption you can make here?!‚Äù demanded Lana, her eyes bloodshot. Claudia pointed to the corner of the room, where Monica‚Äôs uniform hung. Lana looked at it, then blinked. ‚ÄúUm, it was very cold because my uniform was wet, so I took it off to dry it,‚Äù Monica murmured. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt know how to take the corset off by myself, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad you came along, Lana.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana placed her hands on Monica‚Äôs shoulders and gave her a serious look. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre not injured?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd it doesn‚Äôt hurt anywhere?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Monica shook her head. Lana fell to the floor and heaved a sigh of relief.
After Lana helped her undo the corset, Monica removed her soaked-through underwear and changed into a simple set of pajamas she had borrowed from the infirmary. To tell the truth, she‚Äôd been very, very cold, so she grabbed a thin blanket from the bed and wrapped it around herself as well. Claudia silently held out a teacup. Apparently, she‚Äôd prepared her a warm drink. Monica gratefully took it and sipped its contents before her face twisted into a grimace. ‚ÄúI-it‚Äôth so thpithy‚Ä¶ Oof‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt has ginger, red pepper, and citrus peel in it. It‚Äôll warm you up.‚Äù The mixture had been made specifically to provide warmth, without much attention to taste. But Claudia was right‚Äîas Monica sipped at it, she felt heat permeating her body. She breathed a sigh. Glenn, who had eventually been allowed back into the room, asked her, ‚ÄúSo what happened anyway? The president said something about an intruder showing up.‚Äù Monica hesitated for a moment over how much to tell them. Apparently, the people at the chess competition had been informed of the intruder. Sooner or later, whatever info Monica had would be the subject of rumors. I should probably keep quiet about the imperial mage impersonating a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs, she thought. Thanks to Bernie‚Äôs quick thinking, everyone now considered Monica a mere victim who had just happened onto the scene. The intruder probably hadn‚Äôt realized she‚Äôd attacked him with unchanted magecraft, so as long as she and Bernie got their stories straight, she‚Äôd be able to go on with her life at the academy. But there was one thing she didn‚Äôt understand. Why did Bernie cover for me‚Ä¶? He‚Äôd been so hateful toward her and mocked her for pretending to be a student. But in the end, he‚Äôd lied to protect her identity. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, smiling sardonically. But I was already grateful, thought Monica. Ever since we first met. I just don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶ She sighed to herself, then began to fumble through an explanation. ‚ÄúUm, so Bernie‚Ä¶I followed Minerva‚Äôs anchor into the waiting room, and he was fighting the intruder there‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Glenn. ‚ÄúAnd then you got wrapped up in it, yeah? Your clothes are soaked, too. Was it water magecraft or something?‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Pitman was on the floor with his eyes rolled back in his head, Bernie had a bruise on his neck, and Monica was dripping wet. Something strange had clearly happened here. Cyril took off his jacket and put it around Monica‚Äôs shoulders, then asked Bernie, ‚ÄúBernie Jones of Minerva‚Äôs, explain those wounds.‚Äù He stared at the boy dubiously. The situation made it look a lot like Bernie had harmed Pitman and Monica. He couldn‚Äôt blame them for assuming as much. With an absolutely calm demeanor, he answered clearly and confidently. ‚ÄúIt appears someone has switched places with Eugene Pitman. When I saw through the disguise, he attacked me, and I fought him off. Lady Monica Norton happened to come into the waiting room at that very moment and got caught up in the fight.‚Äù Cyril and Neil were speechless at Bernie‚Äôs admission. Bernie glanced down at the mage who had turned himself into Pitman. ‚ÄúThis mage was using body-manipulation magecraft,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs from the Empire.‚Äù The fact that someone had taken the place of a professor from Minerva‚Äôs and infiltrated Serendia Academy was troubling enough by itself. Add other nations into the mix, and the situation became much graver. Realizing this, Cyril‚Äôs expression grew serious. Addressing Neil, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep watch over the scene and get the details from Bernie Jones. You inform the prince and the teachers.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd bring Accountant Norton to the infirmary while you‚Äôre at it. I believe several of her friends were in the audience. Have them stay with her.‚Äù Neil nodded, then asked Monica if she could stand. Monica, still wearing Cyril‚Äôs jacket, glanced over at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes seemed to be asking him why he‚Äôd covered for her. Bernie gave her one of his usual sardonic smiles, fixed his glasses with a finger, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life.‚Äù Cyril and Neil looked confused‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt understand the true meaning behind his words. But Monica gave Bernie a deep bow, then left the waiting room with Neil. The contest between Serendia Academy and Minerva‚Äôs saw a win for Monica in the first match and a win for Minerva‚Äôs in the second. Now only the anchors remained to decide which school would be victorious.

            "brief_description": "A petite, plain, and gloomy commoner student who transferred to Minerva's. Initially perceived as mute, she is quiet and reserved due to a period of isolation, which has affected her speech and makes her anxious about public speaking. She is rescued by Bernie from bullies and helped with her studies. She claims not to be afraid of spiders and is grateful for Bernie's help. She is bullied by her classmates, who cut her hair and steal her possessions. Her understanding of magic formulae is exceptional, and she demonstrates unchanted magecraft, marking her as a true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is selected as one of the Seven Sages. Despite her accomplishments, she remains shy and insecure, and is hurt by Bernie's cruel rejection. She is now attending Serendia Academy and is part of the student council, taking horseback-riding class to guard Prince Felix. She is extremely shy, clumsy, and has awful balance, which makes horseback riding difficult for her. She hates being in front of others, which led her to isolate herself for magecraft research. She isn't scared of horses, but is scared of falling from high places and is more scared of people. She chose horseback riding as an elective despite her poor ballroom dancing grades. She wants to learn horseback riding to tell Casey, her friend, one day. She is confused by Felix's actions and notices his knowledge of magecraft. She is familiar with magic battles from her time at Minerva's and recalls her fear during the Seven Sages qualifiers. She is aware of the failed assassination attempt on Felix by Casey. She feels guilty about her inability to reveal Casey's involvement in the lumber incident and appreciates the kindness of Cyril, Lana, Neil, and Isabelle. She chose chess as her second elective and has studied the textbook in advance. She is invited to chess class by Elliott, but feels awkward due to their social differences. She is questioned by Elliott about why she didn't call him out for using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She doesn't mind being looked down upon and blames herself for not learning the chess rules. She is confused by Elliott's behavior and expresses her desire to simply play chess. She played Elliott to a stalemate. Her chess playing style is thoroughly logical, never wasting a move for a slight advantage. She is warned by Elliot that talented commoners are often envied or exploited, causing her anxiety. She is chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which causes her to panic. She recalls her selection for the Seven Sages qualifiers at Minerva's, orchestrated by Professor Rutherford, and the pressure she felt. She reflects on wanting to share the news with her foster mother and a close friend who taught her unchanted magecraft. She is currently using the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. She is gloomy about reporting her selection for the chess competition to Felix. She volunteers to bring her student council work back to her dorm, but is overruled by Cyril and Elliott. She has been borrowing chess books from the library and eating into her sleep time to read them. She has been having bouts of insomnia after the incident with Casey, and she‚Äôs been holing herself away in her attic room, using chess to distract herself. She doesn‚Äôt own a chessboard, so she‚Äôd drawn squares on a piece of paper and used scraps of wood and small pebbles as the pieces. She‚Äôd play chess with herself, and before she knew it, morning would come. She is eager to win a chess game against Felix in order to ask him for a wish. She defeats Felix in chess with a merciless attack. She asks Felix to stop calling her \"little squirrel,\" but does not specify what she wants to be called instead, leading to further teasing. She is asked by Benjamin and Elliott to be the anchor of the chess team. She is terrified of being the anchor due to past experiences with public speaking and hyperventilation. She learns that Neil Maywood was the anchor of the chess team the previous year, which surprises her. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own. She reveals to Lana that she is participating in the chess competition and is relieved by Lana's positive reaction. She realizes that the chess competition will be against the University and Minerva's, her former school, causing her to panic. She is overwhelmed by the thought of facing people from her past at Minerva's, causing her to hyperventilate and recall hurtful words from Bernie. She promises Lana to visit her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles to sleep due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's and is haunted by memories of Bernie's hurtful words. She finds Nero and Ryn playing a stacking game with chess pieces in her room. She learns that Casey has been sent to a convent in the north after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot against Felix. She reflects on Casey's motives and the potential for Duke Clockford to instigate a war with Landor and the Empire. She decides to face political realities to protect Felix, acknowledging his kindness but questioning his true intentions and whether he is a pawn of Duke Clockford. She resolves to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She instructs Nero and Ryn to monitor for suspicious mana and conversations near Felix. She is speechless at Ryn's proposal of a love triangle. She realizes that Nero and Ryn's adult appearances in school uniforms will attract attention. She visits Lana, who dresses her in a corset and offers to do her makeup for the upcoming chess competition. She receives a makeover from Lana for the chess competition, including light makeup, a slight slant to her bangs, and glasses. She is amazed by her healthy and mature appearance. She is about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is told by Elliott that she looks like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her new look, which pleases her greatly. She is wearing false glasses as a disguise. She believes that wearing glasses makes her look good at chess and is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like an advanced course student. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and is anxious about encountering him at the competition. She sees Bernie Jones among the Minerva's representatives and panics, recalling their last encounter. She focuses on maintaining her composure during the greetings with the University and Minerva's students. She formally greets Bernie Jones as Monica Norton, relying on Lana's makeup and posture advice to maintain her disguise. She freezes under pressure when Mr. Redding questions her skills, and mentally calculates the value of pi to cope with anxiety. She reflects on the importance of appearance as a weapon in society. She fixes her glasses and encourages herself to do her best. She encounters Bernie, who notes her resemblance to someone he knew with the same first name. She feels conflicted about wanting to be Bernie's friend despite his past actions. She is rescued from Bernie by Nero and Ryn, who claim her as their woman. She collapses from exhaustion after the encounter with Bernie. She is embarrassed by Nero and Ryn's disguises and asks them to transform back into a cat and bird. She is taking her seat at the chess competition and is anxious about Bernie discovering her identity and whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch. She chokes when trying to wish Robert Winkel a good game. She initially stumbles over her words, but regains her composure and focuses on the game. She is playing chess very quickly, making moves in three seconds or less. She moves her knight and sighs. She wins her chess match against Robert Winkel with checkmate in a shockingly short amount of time. She attends a mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is approached by Elliott and Benjamin, who accuse her of holding back during their practice games. She is hiding behind Elliott and Benjamin because she is scared of Robert Winkel. She stares blankly at Robert Winkel's marriage proposal, not understanding the situation. She is the object of Robert Winkel's affections because of her chess skills. She is being pursued by Robert Winkel for marriage, but declines his proposal. She is impressed by Robert's logical reasoning for wanting to marry her. She is attacked by Bernie, who reveals that he knows she is one of the Seven Sages. She is verbally attacked by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity and manipulating others. She is deeply hurt by Bernie's insults and struggles to defend herself. She realizes that Bernie hates her and is defended by Lana. She is reminded by Bernie that she is hiding her identity as one of the Seven Sages and that she is lying to Lana. She defends Lana against Bernie's insults, stating that she will no longer tolerate his behavior. She reveals her past desire to gain his approval and be a friend he could be proud of, but declares that she is done seeking his praise. She then turns her back on Bernie and walks away with Lana. She expresses her newfound strength and gratitude to Lana, attributing it to the corset and makeup. She is playing against Bernie in the chess competition. She returns to the competition room and finds Robert Winkel being punished by Felix and Cyril for his continued pursuit of her. She is frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel's punishment. She is surprised but not disturbed by Bernie's change of position in the chess match. She is calm and focused on the game, no longer seeking Bernie's approval. She is playing aggressively and destroying Bernie's plans. She defeats Bernie in chess with checkmate and shows no emotion towards him. She is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman and trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free from the water sphere using unchanted magecraft and defeats the fake Mr. Pitman with a mana-infused wind bullet. She thanks Ryn for telling her that Bernie was in danger. She asks Ryn to have Nero guard Felix. She believes that her fake life at the academy is over.",

            "brief_description": "The second son of Count Ambard, a noble in the Kingdom of Ridill. He is highly intelligent, ambitious, and skilled in magic, especially quick-chanting. Enrolling in Minerva's at age ten, his goal is to become one of the Seven Sages. He is protective of Monica, helping her with her studies and deciding to teach her quick-chanting to help her overcome her fear of public speaking, though he is aware of the bullying she endures but allows it to continue to ensure her dependence on him. He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but is now envious and feels betrayed by her unchanted magecraft, leading him to train recklessly and develop mana poisoning. He resents Monica's success and selection as one of the Seven Sages, and cruelly dismisses her attempts to thank him, reveling in her distress. He finds peace in the rumor that she is living as a hermit. Monica recalls his scornful eyes and hurtful words, blaming herself for their broken friendship. He introduced Monica to chess, but scorned it as a mere idle amusement. He is a representative from Minerva's in the chess competition. He is the son of Count Ambard and is representing Minerva's in the chess competition. He is politely cordial to Monica Norton, unaware that she is Monica Everett. He notes Monica Norton's resemblance to someone he used to know, who shares the same first name. He demands an answer from Monica Norton when she hesitates to answer his questions. He is intimidated by Nero and Ryn and apologizes for bothering Monica Norton before leaving. He is listening intently to the conversation between the teachers and is staring hard at Monica. He is glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is eating lunch and chatting cheerfully with the other students from Minerva's. Monica is trying to keep her distance from him. He attacks Monica with fire magic and reveals that he knows she is one of the Seven Sages. He confronts Monica, accusing her of hiding her identity and manipulating others. He insults her appearance and actions, causing her distress. He grabs Monica's hair and makes cruel remarks about her. He is confronted by Lana for cornering Monica in the hallway and making her cry. He is revealed to hate Monica. He accuses Monica of pretending to be helpless to take advantage of other people and claims that she is hiding her true identity and sponging off everyone else. He is revealed to be jealous of Monica. He is taken aback when Monica lashes out at him. He is left speechless when Monica declares that she is done trying to get his praise. He is determined to keep Monica thinking about him and seeks out Mr. Pitman to change the chess match order. He pressures Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to change the chess match order. He obtains Mr. Macragan's signature to change the chess match order so he can play against Monica. He is changing places with Elliott to play against Monica. He is determined to win against Monica at all costs, even if it means sacrificing pieces. He is defeated by Monica in chess. He is rude and unrefined, unworthy of a son of Count Ambard. He is frustrated and angry after losing to Monica. He is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman, who is an imperial mage in disguise. He is saved by Monica. He attacks the fake Mr. Pitman with lightning arrows, but the mage deflects them. He is grabbed by the mage and unable to chant. He is rescued by Monica. He realizes Monica is on a secret mission to protect Prince Felix. He hides Ryn to protect Monica.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        Nevertheless, he racked his brain, using all his knowledge to try and pin down what, exactly, he was seeing. It had very obviously induced a physical transformation. Magecraft that strengthened or changed the body was called body-manipulation magecraft. Because of its high risk of mana contamination, it was forbidden throughout the world. In recent years, however, one nation had reopened research on the topic. That nation was the empire to the east of the Kingdom of Ridill. ‚ÄúAre you from the Schwargald Empire?‚Äù demanded Bernie. The fake Pitman smiled without answering. If a mage from the Empire had swapped places with Pitman and infiltrated Serendia Academy, he was likely here to either assassinate or kidnap someone important. And the only person who fit that profile‚Äîwho was guaranteed to appear at the chess competition‚Äîwas‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs after Prince Felix! Bernie couldn‚Äôt overlook an intruder bent on harming the second prince. He had to stop this imperial mage‚Äôs scheme, whatever it took. Bernie began to chant, intending to use the most powerful spell in his arsenal, but the imperial mage launched into a sliding dash. He was fast. The man‚Äôs impossibly strong legs propelled him over to Bernie in the blink of an eye. He grabbed the boy‚Äôs neck with one hand, easily lifting him into the air. ‚ÄúGah‚Ä¶hah!‚Äù The false Pitman was a slender man of middling height‚ÄîBernie couldn‚Äôt imagine he had the strength to lift a person with only one hand. But the structure of the hand around Bernie‚Äôs neck was warped. His nails were longer, sharper. The arm itself rippled with unnatural muscle. Apparently, his skin wasn‚Äôt the only thing that had changed. Scales that could block magical attacks, combined with Herculean strength‚Ä¶ I see, thought Bernie. Dragonshifting indeed. He flailed his legs and dug his nails into the arm gripping his neck, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. And worst of all, he couldn‚Äôt chant in this situation. He had to at least warn someone. The Eugene Pitman at Serendia was an imperial mage in disguise, using dangerous body-manipulation magecraft! ‚ÄúBernie?!‚Äù Suddenly, he heard a voice from behind him. He looked around using only his eyes to find Monica standing in the doorway. The imperial mage swore, then began quick-chanting a spell. ‚ÄúDrown and die!‚Äù Immediately, the ground at Monica‚Äôs feet began to glow. Then a sphere of water appeared, enclosing her.
Trapped by the bubble, Monica‚Äôs face warped in pain. Her mouth opened and closed pointlessly. The imperial mage sighed, irritated by the string of interruptions. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have you screaming, you see. I‚Äôm sorry, young lady, but I need you to stay in there until you drown.‚Äù Monica struggled inside the sphere of water, bubbles spurting from her mouth. The sphere used a type of powerful internal barrier, and it was very difficult to escape once inside it. Even mages, unable to chant underwater, would have no choice but to wait for death. Mages who needed to chant, that is. There was a high-pitched noise like the sound of glass breaking. The imperial mage, confused, turned around‚Äîbut by then, the watery barrier enclosing Monica was already covered in cracks, letting the water drain out. ‚ÄúImpossible!‚Äù exclaimed the fake Pitman as the barrier completely burst, spraying water everywhere and releasing Monica to the floor. The girl coughed and coughed but managed to look up and face the imperial mage squarely. Behind her wet, messy bangs, her light-brown eyes glowed with just a hint of green. Wind created from mana blustered up around her. That wind then formed an invisible bullet that proceeded to strike the imperial mage right between his eyes. ‚ÄúGahhh, agh?!‚Äù The one weakness of dragons, which were otherwise highly resistant to magecraft, was the spot between their eyes‚Äîand apparently, the same rule applied to those using dragonshifting magecraft. The blow to his brow concussed the imperial mage. His eyes rolled up, and he fell over backward. Bernie, his neck freed from the mage‚Äôs grasp, fell to the floor, gasping for air. ‚ÄúBernie‚Ä¶ A-are you all right?!‚Äù He looked up to see Monica staring down at him, worry on her face. He sat and fixed his crooked glasses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. More importantly, do you have any idea what‚Äôs going on‚Äî?‚Äù Before he could finish, he heard a tapping noise at the window. He looked over to see a small yellow bird perched outside the glass. Monica ran over and opened the window, letting the bird fly into the room. A moment later, it transformed into a person. This person was someone Bernie recognized. It was the blond man with the far-too-formal clothes. Apparently, he hadn‚Äôt been a man at all but a spirit.
‚ÄúYou have dealt with the assassin wonderfully, Silent Witch.‚Äù ‚ÄúMiss Ryn, thank you for telling me that Bernie was in danger.‚Äù Monica bowed to the blond spirit, then looked down at the imperial mage. ‚ÄúThis person may have been a decoy, so please continue to remain alert. And can you ask Nero to stay near the prince at all times, too?‚Äù ‚ÄúAt once.‚Äù After hearing Monica talk to the spirit, Bernie finally understood why she was here. She was an extremely shy person. She never would have enrolled in Serendia Academy of her own volition. He surmised she was on a mission to protect the second prince‚Äîa top secret one, no doubt. A mission that had demanded she enroll here. Monica wrung out her dripping wet skirt, then picked her glasses off the floor and put them in her pocket. The soaking wet girl with disheveled hair reminded him a lot of Everett the Mute back at Minerva‚Äôs, when her classmates had bullied her. She‚Äôd been sniffling and sobbing back then. But she was different now. Without shedding a single tear, she looked at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he replied gruffly. Monica smiled, a tinge of loneliness to her expression. ‚ÄúIt looks like‚Ä¶this is the end of my fake life at the academy.‚Äù This attempted assassination would probably blow up into a huge incident. The real Eugene Pitman had probably been killed when the imperial mage took his place. With a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs as the victim, it would be impossible to cover up. Monica‚Äôs identity as the one who had captured him would soon be known far and wide, forcing her to leave the academy. Bernie could hear footsteps in the distance‚Äîprobably someone coming to check the waiting room. Ugh, fine! Without taking the time to think it over, Bernie called out. ‚ÄúHave that spirit turn back into a bird. Quickly!‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh? Um, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù As Monica stood there at a loss, not understanding his instruction, the spirit quickly returned to bird form. Bernie then hid the bird behind a shelf. Just as he finished, two people entered the waiting room. They were both members of the academy‚Äôs student council‚ÄîCyril Ashley and Neil Clay Maywood. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this?!‚Äù demanded Cyril. ‚ÄúOh no, oh no! Are you okay, Lady Norton?! You‚Äôre soaking wet!‚Äù cried Neil. The room was a mess.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        That final game would end soon, but Lana was much more concerned about Monica than the chess. After losing to her friend, Bernie Jones had run out of the room. Eventually, Monica had quietly left as well‚Äîprobably to go after him. Lana was worried that Bernie might take his anger out on her or say terrible things to her again. She knew Cyril and Neil had gone to check the waiting room, so she doubted much would happen, but she couldn‚Äôt shake the bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. Eventually, Neil returned. Instead of going back to his seat, though, he quickly walked over to Felix and whispered something in his ear. Is Vice President Ashley not with him? wondered Lana. The fact that Cyril wasn‚Äôt here and the grim expression on Neil‚Äôs face stirred her anxiety even more. Just then, the third match ended. Elliott Howard had won, meaning so had Serendia, with two victories and one defeat. A short break would follow, after which the University would play against Minerva‚Äôs. But just then, Felix stood up and made an announcement. ‚ÄúI apologize for the sudden interruption so soon after the end of the match. However, there‚Äôs something I need everyone to hear.‚Äù His usual smile was gone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve received word of an intruder in the academy.‚Äù Lana was stunned speechless. Everyone else was just as surprised‚Äîand they all looked uneasy. To calm them down, Felix softened his tone a little bit. ‚ÄúThere is no need for alarm. The intruder has already been captured, and security guards are on standby outside this room. But just to be sure, I‚Äôd like to have them patrol the campus, so would everyone please stay here for the time being?‚Äù The room erupted into chatter, but nobody panicked‚Äîthe prince had said there were security guards just outside the door, after all. Wait a minute, thought Lana. What about Monica? She‚Äôs not here. What happened to her? Just as she was about to ask, someone quietly came over to where she was seated‚ÄîNeil. ‚ÄúDo you have a moment?‚Äù he asked, beckoning to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn before lowering his voice and whispering, ‚ÄúLady Norton was at the scene of the intruder‚Äôs capture.‚Äù He then covered Glenn‚Äôs mouth just before the other boy shouted in surprise. It seemed he was becoming quite good at handling him. ‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù he continued.
‚ÄúFortunately, she isn‚Äôt injured, but she‚Äôs probably experiencing some shock‚Ä¶ Would you all go and be with her?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is she now?‚Äù asked Lana immediately. Neil spoke softly so that nobody else would hear. ‚ÄúThe infirmary.‚Äù And so Lana, Claudia, and Glenn snuck out of the room at Neil‚Äôs request and headed for the infirmary with security guards to escort them. ‚ÄúMonica, are you in there? We‚Äôre coming in, okay?‚Äù When they knocked on the infirmary door and peered inside, in place of the resident nurse, they found Monica sitting patiently in a chair‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶wearing nothing but a man‚Äôs jacket over her underwear. Lana wasted no time tackling Glenn and pushing him out of the room, leaving only her and Claudia inside, before shoving the door closed. ‚ÄúWhat was that for?!‚Äù the boy shouted from the hallway, but he wasn‚Äôt important right now. Monica didn‚Äôt seem particularly fazed by Glenn seeing her in her underwear. ‚ÄúOh, hi, Lana,‚Äù she said, remaining seated as she calmly looked up at her. Lana strode over to her friend and asked, her voice shaking, ‚ÄúWhose jacket is that?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril let me borrow it‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana buried her face in her hands and lifted her head toward the ceiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always thought better of Vice President Ashley!‚Äù ‚ÄúL-Lana‚Ä¶?‚Äù stammered Monica. ‚ÄúAnd how could he leave a girl here in a state like this?!‚Äù wailed Lana. Monica lowered her gaze, unsure of what to do. The only calm one in the room, Claudia glanced at Monica‚Äôs dripping wet uniform hanging in the corner and murmured, ‚ÄúThat idiot‚Äôs not the type. I doubt he has the guts.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt that the only assumption you can make here?!‚Äù demanded Lana, her eyes bloodshot. Claudia pointed to the corner of the room, where Monica‚Äôs uniform hung. Lana looked at it, then blinked. ‚ÄúUm, it was very cold because my uniform was wet, so I took it off to dry it,‚Äù Monica murmured. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt know how to take the corset off by myself, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad you came along, Lana.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana placed her hands on Monica‚Äôs shoulders and gave her a serious look. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre not injured?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd it doesn‚Äôt hurt anywhere?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Monica shook her head. Lana fell to the floor and heaved a sigh of relief.
After Lana helped her undo the corset, Monica removed her soaked-through underwear and changed into a simple set of pajamas she had borrowed from the infirmary. To tell the truth, she‚Äôd been very, very cold, so she grabbed a thin blanket from the bed and wrapped it around herself as well. Claudia silently held out a teacup. Apparently, she‚Äôd prepared her a warm drink. Monica gratefully took it and sipped its contents before her face twisted into a grimace. ‚ÄúI-it‚Äôth so thpithy‚Ä¶ Oof‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt has ginger, red pepper, and citrus peel in it. It‚Äôll warm you up.‚Äù The mixture had been made specifically to provide warmth, without much attention to taste. But Claudia was right‚Äîas Monica sipped at it, she felt heat permeating her body. She breathed a sigh. Glenn, who had eventually been allowed back into the room, asked her, ‚ÄúSo what happened anyway? The president said something about an intruder showing up.‚Äù Monica hesitated for a moment over how much to tell them. Apparently, the people at the chess competition had been informed of the intruder. Sooner or later, whatever info Monica had would be the subject of rumors. I should probably keep quiet about the imperial mage impersonating a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs, she thought. Thanks to Bernie‚Äôs quick thinking, everyone now considered Monica a mere victim who had just happened onto the scene. The intruder probably hadn‚Äôt realized she‚Äôd attacked him with unchanted magecraft, so as long as she and Bernie got their stories straight, she‚Äôd be able to go on with her life at the academy. But there was one thing she didn‚Äôt understand. Why did Bernie cover for me‚Ä¶? He‚Äôd been so hateful toward her and mocked her for pretending to be a student. But in the end, he‚Äôd lied to protect her identity. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, smiling sardonically. But I was already grateful, thought Monica. Ever since we first met. I just don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶ She sighed to herself, then began to fumble through an explanation. ‚ÄúUm, so Bernie‚Ä¶I followed Minerva‚Äôs anchor into the waiting room, and he was fighting the intruder there‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Glenn. ‚ÄúAnd then you got wrapped up in it, yeah? Your clothes are soaked, too. Was it water magecraft or something?‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Pitman was on the floor with his eyes rolled back in his head, Bernie had a bruise on his neck, and Monica was dripping wet. Something strange had clearly happened here. Cyril took off his jacket and put it around Monica‚Äôs shoulders, then asked Bernie, ‚ÄúBernie Jones of Minerva‚Äôs, explain those wounds.‚Äù He stared at the boy dubiously. The situation made it look a lot like Bernie had harmed Pitman and Monica. He couldn‚Äôt blame them for assuming as much. With an absolutely calm demeanor, he answered clearly and confidently. ‚ÄúIt appears someone has switched places with Eugene Pitman. When I saw through the disguise, he attacked me, and I fought him off. Lady Monica Norton happened to come into the waiting room at that very moment and got caught up in the fight.‚Äù Cyril and Neil were speechless at Bernie‚Äôs admission. Bernie glanced down at the mage who had turned himself into Pitman. ‚ÄúThis mage was using body-manipulation magecraft,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs from the Empire.‚Äù The fact that someone had taken the place of a professor from Minerva‚Äôs and infiltrated Serendia Academy was troubling enough by itself. Add other nations into the mix, and the situation became much graver. Realizing this, Cyril‚Äôs expression grew serious. Addressing Neil, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep watch over the scene and get the details from Bernie Jones. You inform the prince and the teachers.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd bring Accountant Norton to the infirmary while you‚Äôre at it. I believe several of her friends were in the audience. Have them stay with her.‚Äù Neil nodded, then asked Monica if she could stand. Monica, still wearing Cyril‚Äôs jacket, glanced over at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes seemed to be asking him why he‚Äôd covered for her. Bernie gave her one of his usual sardonic smiles, fixed his glasses with a finger, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life.‚Äù Cyril and Neil looked confused‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt understand the true meaning behind his words. But Monica gave Bernie a deep bow, then left the waiting room with Neil. The contest between Serendia Academy and Minerva‚Äôs saw a win for Monica in the first match and a win for Minerva‚Äôs in the second. Now only the anchors remained to decide which school would be victorious.

            "brief_description": "A petite, plain, and gloomy commoner student who transferred to Minerva's. Initially perceived as mute, she is quiet and reserved due to a period of isolation, which has affected her speech and makes her anxious about public speaking. She is rescued by Bernie from bullies and helped with her studies. She claims not to be afraid of spiders and is grateful for Bernie's help. She is bullied by her classmates, who cut her hair and steal her possessions. Her understanding of magic formulae is exceptional, and she demonstrates unchanted magecraft, marking her as a true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is selected as one of the Seven Sages. Despite her accomplishments, she remains shy and insecure, and is hurt by Bernie's cruel rejection. She is now attending Serendia Academy and is part of the student council, taking horseback-riding class to guard Prince Felix. She is extremely shy, clumsy, and has awful balance, which makes horseback riding difficult for her. She hates being in front of others, which led her to isolate herself for magecraft research. She isn't scared of horses, but is scared of falling from high places and is more scared of people. She chose horseback riding as an elective despite her poor ballroom dancing grades. She wants to learn horseback riding to tell Casey, her friend, one day. She is confused by Felix's actions and notices his knowledge of magecraft. She is familiar with magic battles from her time at Minerva's and recalls her fear during the Seven Sages qualifiers. She is aware of the failed assassination attempt on Felix by Casey. She feels guilty about her inability to reveal Casey's involvement in the lumber incident and appreciates the kindness of Cyril, Lana, Neil, and Isabelle. She chose chess as her second elective and has studied the textbook in advance. She is invited to chess class by Elliott, but feels awkward due to their social differences. She is questioned by Elliott about why she didn't call him out for using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She doesn't mind being looked down upon and blames herself for not learning the chess rules. She is confused by Elliott's behavior and expresses her desire to simply play chess. She played Elliott to a stalemate. Her chess playing style is thoroughly logical, never wasting a move for a slight advantage. She is warned by Elliot that talented commoners are often envied or exploited, causing her anxiety. She is chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which causes her to panic. She recalls her selection for the Seven Sages qualifiers at Minerva's, orchestrated by Professor Rutherford, and the pressure she felt. She reflects on wanting to share the news with her foster mother and a close friend who taught her unchanted magecraft. She is currently using the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. She is gloomy about reporting her selection for the chess competition to Felix. She volunteers to bring her student council work back to her dorm, but is overruled by Cyril and Elliott. She has been borrowing chess books from the library and eating into her sleep time to read them. She has been having bouts of insomnia after the incident with Casey, and she‚Äôs been holing herself away in her attic room, using chess to distract herself. She doesn‚Äôt own a chessboard, so she‚Äôd drawn squares on a piece of paper and used scraps of wood and small pebbles as the pieces. She‚Äôd play chess with herself, and before she knew it, morning would come. She is eager to win a chess game against Felix in order to ask him for a wish. She defeats Felix in chess with a merciless attack. She asks Felix to stop calling her \"little squirrel,\" but does not specify what she wants to be called instead, leading to further teasing. She is asked by Benjamin and Elliott to be the anchor of the chess team. She is terrified of being the anchor due to past experiences with public speaking and hyperventilation. She learns that Neil Maywood was the anchor of the chess team the previous year, which surprises her. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own. She reveals to Lana that she is participating in the chess competition and is relieved by Lana's positive reaction. She realizes that the chess competition will be against the University and Minerva's, her former school, causing her to panic. She is overwhelmed by the thought of facing people from her past at Minerva's, causing her to hyperventilate and recall hurtful words from Bernie. She promises Lana to visit her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles to sleep due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's and is haunted by memories of Bernie's hurtful words. She finds Nero and Ryn playing a stacking game with chess pieces in her room. She learns that Casey has been sent to a convent in the north after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot against Felix. She reflects on Casey's motives and the potential for Duke Clockford to instigate a war with Landor and the Empire. She decides to face political realities to protect Felix, acknowledging his kindness but questioning his true intentions and whether he is a pawn of Duke Clockford. She resolves to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She instructs Nero and Ryn to monitor for suspicious mana and conversations near Felix. She is speechless at Ryn's proposal of a love triangle. She realizes that Nero and Ryn's adult appearances in school uniforms will attract attention. She visits Lana, who dresses her in a corset and offers to do her makeup for the upcoming chess competition. She receives a makeover from Lana for the chess competition, including light makeup, a slight slant to her bangs, and glasses. She is amazed by her healthy and mature appearance. She is about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is told by Elliott that she looks like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her new look, which pleases her greatly. She is wearing false glasses as a disguise. She believes that wearing glasses makes her look good at chess and is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like an advanced course student. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and is anxious about encountering him at the competition. She sees Bernie Jones among the Minerva's representatives and panics, recalling their last encounter. She focuses on maintaining her composure during the greetings with the University and Minerva's students. She formally greets Bernie Jones as Monica Norton, relying on Lana's makeup and posture advice to maintain her disguise. She freezes under pressure when Mr. Redding questions her skills, and mentally calculates the value of pi to cope with anxiety. She reflects on the importance of appearance as a weapon in society. She fixes her glasses and encourages herself to do her best. She encounters Bernie, who notes her resemblance to someone he knew with the same first name. She feels conflicted about wanting to be Bernie's friend despite his past actions. She is rescued from Bernie by Nero and Ryn, who claim her as their woman. She collapses from exhaustion after the encounter with Bernie. She is embarrassed by Nero and Ryn's disguises and asks them to transform back into a cat and bird. She is taking her seat at the chess competition and is anxious about Bernie discovering her identity and whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch. She chokes when trying to wish Robert Winkel a good game. She initially stumbles over her words, but regains her composure and focuses on the game. She is playing chess very quickly, making moves in three seconds or less. She moves her knight and sighs. She wins her chess match against Robert Winkel with checkmate in a shockingly short amount of time. She attends a mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is approached by Elliott and Benjamin, who accuse her of holding back during their practice games. She is hiding behind Elliott and Benjamin because she is scared of Robert Winkel. She stares blankly at Robert Winkel's marriage proposal, not understanding the situation. She is the object of Robert Winkel's affections because of her chess skills. She is being pursued by Robert Winkel for marriage, but declines his proposal. She is impressed by Robert's logical reasoning for wanting to marry her. She is attacked by Bernie, who reveals that he knows she is one of the Seven Sages. She is verbally attacked by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity and manipulating others. She is deeply hurt by Bernie's insults and struggles to defend herself. She realizes that Bernie hates her and is defended by Lana. She is reminded by Bernie that she is hiding her identity as one of the Seven Sages and that she is lying to Lana. She defends Lana against Bernie's insults, stating that she will no longer tolerate his behavior. She reveals her past desire to gain his approval and be a friend he could be proud of, but declares that she is done seeking his praise. She then turns her back on Bernie and walks away with Lana. She expresses her newfound strength and gratitude to Lana, attributing it to the corset and makeup. She is playing against Bernie in the chess competition. She returns to the competition room and finds Robert Winkel being punished by Felix and Cyril for his continued pursuit of her. She is frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel's punishment. She is surprised but not disturbed by Bernie's change of position in the chess match. She is calm and focused on the game, no longer seeking Bernie's approval. She is playing aggressively and destroying Bernie's plans. She defeats Bernie in chess with checkmate and shows no emotion towards him. She is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman and trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free from the water sphere using unchanted magecraft and defeats the fake Mr. Pitman with a mana-infused wind bullet. She thanks Ryn for telling her that Bernie was in danger. She asks Ryn to have Nero guard Felix. She believes that her fake life at the academy is over.",

            "brief_description": "The second son of Count Ambard, a noble in the Kingdom of Ridill. He is highly intelligent, ambitious, and skilled in magic, especially quick-chanting. Enrolling in Minerva's at age ten, his goal is to become one of the Seven Sages. He is protective of Monica, helping her with her studies and deciding to teach her quick-chanting to help her overcome her fear of public speaking, though he is aware of the bullying she endures but allows it to continue to ensure her dependence on him. He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but is now envious and feels betrayed by her unchanted magecraft, leading him to train recklessly and develop mana poisoning. He resents Monica's success and selection as one of the Seven Sages, and cruelly dismisses her attempts to thank him, reveling in her distress. He finds peace in the rumor that she is living as a hermit. Monica recalls his scornful eyes and hurtful words, blaming herself for their broken friendship. He introduced Monica to chess, but scorned it as a mere idle amusement. He is a representative from Minerva's in the chess competition. He is the son of Count Ambard and is representing Minerva's in the chess competition. He is politely cordial to Monica Norton, unaware that she is Monica Everett. He notes Monica Norton's resemblance to someone he used to know, who shares the same first name. He demands an answer from Monica Norton when she hesitates to answer his questions. He is intimidated by Nero and Ryn and apologizes for bothering Monica Norton before leaving. He is listening intently to the conversation between the teachers and is staring hard at Monica. He is glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is eating lunch and chatting cheerfully with the other students from Minerva's. Monica is trying to keep her distance from him.

He insults her appearance and actions, causing her distress. He grabs Monica's hair and makes cruel remarks about her. He is confronted by Lana for cornering Monica in the hallway and making her cry. He is revealed to hate Monica. He accuses Monica of pretending to be helpless to take advantage of other people and claims that she is hiding her true identity and sponging off everyone else. He is revealed to be jealous of Monica. He is taken aback when Monica lashes out at him. He is left speechless when Monica declares that she is done trying to get his praise. He is determined to keep Monica thinking about him and seeks out Mr. Pitman to change the chess match order. He pressures Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to change the chess match order. He obtains Mr. Macragan's signature to change the chess match order so he can play against Monica. He is changing places with Elliott to play against Monica. He is determined to win against Monica at all costs, even if it means sacrificing pieces. He is defeated by Monica in chess. He is rude and unrefined, unworthy of a son of Count Ambard. He is frustrated and angry after losing to Monica. He is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman, who is an imperial mage in disguise. He is saved by Monica.

He admits he didn't explain castling because he was being cocky and trying to win easily. He recalls his childhood resentment towards Felix due to his clumsiness and perceived incompetence. As a child, he teased Felix and caused him to fall from a tree, resulting in an injury and a scar. He initially felt guilty but was covered for by Felix. He is beginning to understand Felix's affinity for Monica. His chess playing style focuses too much on each piece‚Äôs prescribed role, giving higher-ranking pieces a greater role in his strategy. He reveals that his uncle committed suicide after being betrayed by his commoner wife, reinforcing his prejudice against commoners who act above their station. He warns Monica that talented commoners are often envied or exploited. He is chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on the chess competition rather than her council work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess and studying until he fainted. He describes Monica as a total beast at chess. He realizes Monica held back in their chess game and pinches her cheeks as punishment. He threatens to tell on her and have her position switched. He agrees with Benjamin that Monica should be the anchor of the chess team. He reluctantly agrees to remain the anchor after Monica's desperate pleas. He reveals that Officer Maywood was the anchor of the chess team the previous year. He remarks that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course. He attempts to lighten the mood when Monica freezes under pressure during the pre-competition greetings. He is the glue holding the chess team together. He lost his chess match against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice games. He is surprised by Robert Winkel's marriage proposal to Monica. He believes Monica is being too honest. He warns Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel being punished. He is insulted by Bernie switching places with him to play against Monica.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        Nevertheless, he racked his brain, using all his knowledge to try and pin down what, exactly, he was seeing. It had very obviously induced a physical transformation. Magecraft that strengthened or changed the body was called body-manipulation magecraft. Because of its high risk of mana contamination, it was forbidden throughout the world. In recent years, however, one nation had reopened research on the topic. That nation was the empire to the east of the Kingdom of Ridill. ‚ÄúAre you from the Schwargald Empire?‚Äù demanded Bernie. The fake Pitman smiled without answering. If a mage from the Empire had swapped places with Pitman and infiltrated Serendia Academy, he was likely here to either assassinate or kidnap someone important. And the only person who fit that profile‚Äîwho was guaranteed to appear at the chess competition‚Äîwas‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs after Prince Felix! Bernie couldn‚Äôt overlook an intruder bent on harming the second prince. He had to stop this imperial mage‚Äôs scheme, whatever it took. Bernie began to chant, intending to use the most powerful spell in his arsenal, but the imperial mage launched into a sliding dash. He was fast. The man‚Äôs impossibly strong legs propelled him over to Bernie in the blink of an eye. He grabbed the boy‚Äôs neck with one hand, easily lifting him into the air. ‚ÄúGah‚Ä¶hah!‚Äù The false Pitman was a slender man of middling height‚ÄîBernie couldn‚Äôt imagine he had the strength to lift a person with only one hand. But the structure of the hand around Bernie‚Äôs neck was warped. His nails were longer, sharper. The arm itself rippled with unnatural muscle. Apparently, his skin wasn‚Äôt the only thing that had changed. Scales that could block magical attacks, combined with Herculean strength‚Ä¶ I see, thought Bernie. Dragonshifting indeed. He flailed his legs and dug his nails into the arm gripping his neck, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. And worst of all, he couldn‚Äôt chant in this situation. He had to at least warn someone. The Eugene Pitman at Serendia was an imperial mage in disguise, using dangerous body-manipulation magecraft! ‚ÄúBernie?!‚Äù Suddenly, he heard a voice from behind him. He looked around using only his eyes to find Monica standing in the doorway. The imperial mage swore, then began quick-chanting a spell. ‚ÄúDrown and die!‚Äù Immediately, the ground at Monica‚Äôs feet began to glow. Then a sphere of water appeared, enclosing her.
Trapped by the bubble, Monica‚Äôs face warped in pain. Her mouth opened and closed pointlessly. The imperial mage sighed, irritated by the string of interruptions. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have you screaming, you see. I‚Äôm sorry, young lady, but I need you to stay in there until you drown.‚Äù Monica struggled inside the sphere of water, bubbles spurting from her mouth. The sphere used a type of powerful internal barrier, and it was very difficult to escape once inside it. Even mages, unable to chant underwater, would have no choice but to wait for death. Mages who needed to chant, that is. There was a high-pitched noise like the sound of glass breaking. The imperial mage, confused, turned around‚Äîbut by then, the watery barrier enclosing Monica was already covered in cracks, letting the water drain out. ‚ÄúImpossible!‚Äù exclaimed the fake Pitman as the barrier completely burst, spraying water everywhere and releasing Monica to the floor. The girl coughed and coughed but managed to look up and face the imperial mage squarely. Behind her wet, messy bangs, her light-brown eyes glowed with just a hint of green. Wind created from mana blustered up around her. That wind then formed an invisible bullet that proceeded to strike the imperial mage right between his eyes. ‚ÄúGahhh, agh?!‚Äù The one weakness of dragons, which were otherwise highly resistant to magecraft, was the spot between their eyes‚Äîand apparently, the same rule applied to those using dragonshifting magecraft. The blow to his brow concussed the imperial mage. His eyes rolled up, and he fell over backward. Bernie, his neck freed from the mage‚Äôs grasp, fell to the floor, gasping for air. ‚ÄúBernie‚Ä¶ A-are you all right?!‚Äù He looked up to see Monica staring down at him, worry on her face. He sat and fixed his crooked glasses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. More importantly, do you have any idea what‚Äôs going on‚Äî?‚Äù Before he could finish, he heard a tapping noise at the window. He looked over to see a small yellow bird perched outside the glass. Monica ran over and opened the window, letting the bird fly into the room. A moment later, it transformed into a person. This person was someone Bernie recognized. It was the blond man with the far-too-formal clothes. Apparently, he hadn‚Äôt been a man at all but a spirit.
‚ÄúYou have dealt with the assassin wonderfully, Silent Witch.‚Äù ‚ÄúMiss Ryn, thank you for telling me that Bernie was in danger.‚Äù Monica bowed to the blond spirit, then looked down at the imperial mage. ‚ÄúThis person may have been a decoy, so please continue to remain alert. And can you ask Nero to stay near the prince at all times, too?‚Äù ‚ÄúAt once.‚Äù After hearing Monica talk to the spirit, Bernie finally understood why she was here. She was an extremely shy person. She never would have enrolled in Serendia Academy of her own volition. He surmised she was on a mission to protect the second prince‚Äîa top secret one, no doubt. A mission that had demanded she enroll here. Monica wrung out her dripping wet skirt, then picked her glasses off the floor and put them in her pocket. The soaking wet girl with disheveled hair reminded him a lot of Everett the Mute back at Minerva‚Äôs, when her classmates had bullied her. She‚Äôd been sniffling and sobbing back then. But she was different now. Without shedding a single tear, she looked at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he replied gruffly. Monica smiled, a tinge of loneliness to her expression. ‚ÄúIt looks like‚Ä¶this is the end of my fake life at the academy.‚Äù This attempted assassination would probably blow up into a huge incident. The real Eugene Pitman had probably been killed when the imperial mage took his place. With a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs as the victim, it would be impossible to cover up. Monica‚Äôs identity as the one who had captured him would soon be known far and wide, forcing her to leave the academy. Bernie could hear footsteps in the distance‚Äîprobably someone coming to check the waiting room. Ugh, fine! Without taking the time to think it over, Bernie called out. ‚ÄúHave that spirit turn back into a bird. Quickly!‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh? Um, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù As Monica stood there at a loss, not understanding his instruction, the spirit quickly returned to bird form. Bernie then hid the bird behind a shelf. Just as he finished, two people entered the waiting room. They were both members of the academy‚Äôs student council‚ÄîCyril Ashley and Neil Clay Maywood. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this?!‚Äù demanded Cyril. ‚ÄúOh no, oh no! Are you okay, Lady Norton?! You‚Äôre soaking wet!‚Äù cried Neil. The room was a mess.

        That final game would end soon, but Lana was much more concerned about Monica than the chess. After losing to her friend, Bernie Jones had run out of the room. Eventually, Monica had quietly left as well‚Äîprobably to go after him. Lana was worried that Bernie might take his anger out on her or say terrible things to her again. She knew Cyril and Neil had gone to check the waiting room, so she doubted much would happen, but she couldn‚Äôt shake the bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. Eventually, Neil returned. Instead of going back to his seat, though, he quickly walked over to Felix and whispered something in his ear. Is Vice President Ashley not with him? wondered Lana. The fact that Cyril wasn‚Äôt here and the grim expression on Neil‚Äôs face stirred her anxiety even more. Just then, the third match ended. Elliott Howard had won, meaning so had Serendia, with two victories and one defeat. A short break would follow, after which the University would play against Minerva‚Äôs. But just then, Felix stood up and made an announcement. ‚ÄúI apologize for the sudden interruption so soon after the end of the match. However, there‚Äôs something I need everyone to hear.‚Äù His usual smile was gone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve received word of an intruder in the academy.‚Äù Lana was stunned speechless. Everyone else was just as surprised‚Äîand they all looked uneasy. To calm them down, Felix softened his tone a little bit. ‚ÄúThere is no need for alarm. The intruder has already been captured, and security guards are on standby outside this room. But just to be sure, I‚Äôd like to have them patrol the campus, so would everyone please stay here for the time being?‚Äù The room erupted into chatter, but nobody panicked‚Äîthe prince had said there were security guards just outside the door, after all. Wait a minute, thought Lana. What about Monica? She‚Äôs not here. What happened to her? Just as she was about to ask, someone quietly came over to where she was seated‚ÄîNeil. ‚ÄúDo you have a moment?‚Äù he asked, beckoning to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn before lowering his voice and whispering, ‚ÄúLady Norton was at the scene of the intruder‚Äôs capture.‚Äù He then covered Glenn‚Äôs mouth just before the other boy shouted in surprise. It seemed he was becoming quite good at handling him. ‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù he continued.
‚ÄúFortunately, she isn‚Äôt injured, but she‚Äôs probably experiencing some shock‚Ä¶ Would you all go and be with her?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is she now?‚Äù asked Lana immediately. Neil spoke softly so that nobody else would hear. ‚ÄúThe infirmary.‚Äù And so Lana, Claudia, and Glenn snuck out of the room at Neil‚Äôs request and headed for the infirmary with security guards to escort them. ‚ÄúMonica, are you in there? We‚Äôre coming in, okay?‚Äù When they knocked on the infirmary door and peered inside, in place of the resident nurse, they found Monica sitting patiently in a chair‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶wearing nothing but a man‚Äôs jacket over her underwear. Lana wasted no time tackling Glenn and pushing him out of the room, leaving only her and Claudia inside, before shoving the door closed. ‚ÄúWhat was that for?!‚Äù the boy shouted from the hallway, but he wasn‚Äôt important right now. Monica didn‚Äôt seem particularly fazed by Glenn seeing her in her underwear. ‚ÄúOh, hi, Lana,‚Äù she said, remaining seated as she calmly looked up at her. Lana strode over to her friend and asked, her voice shaking, ‚ÄúWhose jacket is that?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril let me borrow it‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana buried her face in her hands and lifted her head toward the ceiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always thought better of Vice President Ashley!‚Äù ‚ÄúL-Lana‚Ä¶?‚Äù stammered Monica. ‚ÄúAnd how could he leave a girl here in a state like this?!‚Äù wailed Lana. Monica lowered her gaze, unsure of what to do. The only calm one in the room, Claudia glanced at Monica‚Äôs dripping wet uniform hanging in the corner and murmured, ‚ÄúThat idiot‚Äôs not the type. I doubt he has the guts.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt that the only assumption you can make here?!‚Äù demanded Lana, her eyes bloodshot. Claudia pointed to the corner of the room, where Monica‚Äôs uniform hung. Lana looked at it, then blinked. ‚ÄúUm, it was very cold because my uniform was wet, so I took it off to dry it,‚Äù Monica murmured. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt know how to take the corset off by myself, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad you came along, Lana.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana placed her hands on Monica‚Äôs shoulders and gave her a serious look. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre not injured?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd it doesn‚Äôt hurt anywhere?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Monica shook her head. Lana fell to the floor and heaved a sigh of relief.
After Lana helped her undo the corset, Monica removed her soaked-through underwear and changed into a simple set of pajamas she had borrowed from the infirmary. To tell the truth, she‚Äôd been very, very cold, so she grabbed a thin blanket from the bed and wrapped it around herself as well. Claudia silently held out a teacup. Apparently, she‚Äôd prepared her a warm drink. Monica gratefully took it and sipped its contents before her face twisted into a grimace. ‚ÄúI-it‚Äôth so thpithy‚Ä¶ Oof‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt has ginger, red pepper, and citrus peel in it. It‚Äôll warm you up.‚Äù The mixture had been made specifically to provide warmth, without much attention to taste. But Claudia was right‚Äîas Monica sipped at it, she felt heat permeating her body. She breathed a sigh. Glenn, who had eventually been allowed back into the room, asked her, ‚ÄúSo what happened anyway? The president said something about an intruder showing up.‚Äù Monica hesitated for a moment over how much to tell them. Apparently, the people at the chess competition had been informed of the intruder. Sooner or later, whatever info Monica had would be the subject of rumors. I should probably keep quiet about the imperial mage impersonating a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs, she thought. Thanks to Bernie‚Äôs quick thinking, everyone now considered Monica a mere victim who had just happened onto the scene. The intruder probably hadn‚Äôt realized she‚Äôd attacked him with unchanted magecraft, so as long as she and Bernie got their stories straight, she‚Äôd be able to go on with her life at the academy. But there was one thing she didn‚Äôt understand. Why did Bernie cover for me‚Ä¶? He‚Äôd been so hateful toward her and mocked her for pretending to be a student. But in the end, he‚Äôd lied to protect her identity. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, smiling sardonically. But I was already grateful, thought Monica. Ever since we first met. I just don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶ She sighed to herself, then began to fumble through an explanation. ‚ÄúUm, so Bernie‚Ä¶I followed Minerva‚Äôs anchor into the waiting room, and he was fighting the intruder there‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Glenn. ‚ÄúAnd then you got wrapped up in it, yeah? Your clothes are soaked, too. Was it water magecraft or something?‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        Pitman was on the floor with his eyes rolled back in his head, Bernie had a bruise on his neck, and Monica was dripping wet. Something strange had clearly happened here. Cyril took off his jacket and put it around Monica‚Äôs shoulders, then asked Bernie, ‚ÄúBernie Jones of Minerva‚Äôs, explain those wounds.‚Äù He stared at the boy dubiously. The situation made it look a lot like Bernie had harmed Pitman and Monica. He couldn‚Äôt blame them for assuming as much. With an absolutely calm demeanor, he answered clearly and confidently. ‚ÄúIt appears someone has switched places with Eugene Pitman. When I saw through the disguise, he attacked me, and I fought him off. Lady Monica Norton happened to come into the waiting room at that very moment and got caught up in the fight.‚Äù Cyril and Neil were speechless at Bernie‚Äôs admission. Bernie glanced down at the mage who had turned himself into Pitman. ‚ÄúThis mage was using body-manipulation magecraft,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs from the Empire.‚Äù The fact that someone had taken the place of a professor from Minerva‚Äôs and infiltrated Serendia Academy was troubling enough by itself. Add other nations into the mix, and the situation became much graver. Realizing this, Cyril‚Äôs expression grew serious. Addressing Neil, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep watch over the scene and get the details from Bernie Jones. You inform the prince and the teachers.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd bring Accountant Norton to the infirmary while you‚Äôre at it. I believe several of her friends were in the audience. Have them stay with her.‚Äù Neil nodded, then asked Monica if she could stand. Monica, still wearing Cyril‚Äôs jacket, glanced over at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes seemed to be asking him why he‚Äôd covered for her. Bernie gave her one of his usual sardonic smiles, fixed his glasses with a finger, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life.‚Äù Cyril and Neil looked confused‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt understand the true meaning behind his words. But Monica gave Bernie a deep bow, then left the waiting room with Neil. The contest between Serendia Academy and Minerva‚Äôs saw a win for Monica in the first match and a win for Minerva‚Äôs in the second. Now only the anchors remained to decide which school would be victorious.

            "brief_description": "A petite, plain, and gloomy commoner student who transferred to Minerva's. Initially perceived as mute, she is quiet and reserved due to a period of isolation, which has affected her speech and makes her anxious about public speaking. She is rescued by Bernie from bullies and helped with her studies. She claims not to be afraid of spiders and is grateful for Bernie's help. She is bullied by her classmates, who cut her hair and steal her possessions. Her understanding of magic formulae is exceptional, and she demonstrates unchanted magecraft, marking her as a true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is selected as one of the Seven Sages. Despite her accomplishments, she remains shy and insecure, and is hurt by Bernie's cruel rejection. She is now attending Serendia Academy and is part of the student council, taking horseback-riding class to guard Prince Felix. She is extremely shy, clumsy, and has awful balance, which makes horseback riding difficult for her. She hates being in front of others, which led her to isolate herself for magecraft research. She isn't scared of horses, but is scared of falling from high places and is more scared of people. She chose horseback riding as an elective despite her poor ballroom dancing grades. She wants to learn horseback riding to tell Casey, her friend, one day. She is confused by Felix's actions and notices his knowledge of magecraft. She is familiar with magic battles from her time at Minerva's and recalls her fear during the Seven Sages qualifiers. She is aware of the failed assassination attempt on Felix by Casey. She feels guilty about her inability to reveal Casey's involvement in the lumber incident and appreciates the kindness of Cyril, Lana, Neil, and Isabelle. She chose chess as her second elective and has studied the textbook in advance. She is invited to chess class by Elliott, but feels awkward due to their social differences. She is questioned by Elliott about why she didn't call him out for using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She doesn't mind being looked down upon and blames herself for not learning the chess rules. She is confused by Elliott's behavior and expresses her desire to simply play chess. She played Elliott to a stalemate. Her chess playing style is thoroughly logical, never wasting a move for a slight advantage. She is warned by Elliot that talented commoners are often envied or exploited, causing her anxiety. She is chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which causes her to panic. She recalls her selection for the Seven Sages qualifiers at Minerva's, orchestrated by Professor Rutherford, and the pressure she felt. She reflects on wanting to share the news with her foster mother and a close friend who taught her unchanted magecraft. She is currently using the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. She is gloomy about reporting her selection for the chess competition to Felix. She volunteers to bring her student council work back to her dorm, but is overruled by Cyril and Elliott. She has been borrowing chess books from the library and eating into her sleep time to read them. She has been having bouts of insomnia after the incident with Casey, and she‚Äôs been holing herself away in her attic room, using chess to distract herself. She doesn‚Äôt own a chessboard, so she‚Äôd drawn squares on a piece of paper and used scraps of wood and small pebbles as the pieces. She‚Äôd play chess with herself, and before she knew it, morning would come. She is eager to win a chess game against Felix in order to ask him for a wish. She defeats Felix in chess with a merciless attack. She asks Felix to stop calling her \"little squirrel,\" but does not specify what she wants to be called instead, leading to further teasing. She is asked by Benjamin and Elliott to be the anchor of the chess team. She is terrified of being the anchor due to past experiences with public speaking and hyperventilation. She learns that Neil Maywood was the anchor of the chess team the previous year, which surprises her. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own. She reveals to Lana that she is participating in the chess competition and is relieved by Lana's positive reaction. She realizes that the chess competition will be against the University and Minerva's, her former school, causing her to panic. She is overwhelmed by the thought of facing people from her past at Minerva's, causing her to hyperventilate and recall hurtful words from Bernie. She promises Lana to visit her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles to sleep due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's and is haunted by memories of Bernie's hurtful words. She finds Nero and Ryn playing a stacking game with chess pieces in her room. She learns that Casey has been sent to a convent in the north after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot against Felix. She reflects on Casey's motives and the potential for Duke Clockford to instigate a war with Landor and the Empire. She decides to face political realities to protect Felix, acknowledging his kindness but questioning his true intentions and whether he is a pawn of Duke Clockford. She resolves to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She instructs Nero and Ryn to monitor for suspicious mana and conversations near Felix. She is speechless at Ryn's proposal of a love triangle. She realizes that Nero and Ryn's adult appearances in school uniforms will attract attention. She visits Lana, who dresses her in a corset and offers to do her makeup for the upcoming chess competition. She receives a makeover from Lana for the chess competition, including light makeup, a slight slant to her bangs, and glasses. She is amazed by her healthy and mature appearance. She is about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is told by Elliott that she looks like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her new look, which pleases her greatly. She is wearing false glasses as a disguise. She believes that wearing glasses makes her look good at chess and is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like an advanced course student. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and is anxious about encountering him at the competition. She sees Bernie Jones among the Minerva's representatives and panics, recalling their last encounter. She focuses on maintaining her composure during the greetings with the University and Minerva's students. She formally greets Bernie Jones as Monica Norton, relying on Lana's makeup and posture advice to maintain her disguise. She freezes under pressure when Mr. Redding questions her skills, and mentally calculates the value of pi to cope with anxiety. She reflects on the importance of appearance as a weapon in society. She fixes her glasses and encourages herself to do her best. She encounters Bernie, who notes her resemblance to someone he knew with the same first name. She feels conflicted about wanting to be Bernie's friend despite his past actions. She is rescued from Bernie by Nero and Ryn, who claim her as their woman. She collapses from exhaustion after the encounter with Bernie. She is embarrassed by Nero and Ryn's disguises and asks them to transform back into a cat and bird. She is taking her seat at the chess competition and is anxious about Bernie discovering her identity and whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch. She chokes when trying to wish Robert Winkel a good game. She initially stumbles over her words, but regains her composure and focuses on the game. She is playing chess very quickly, making moves in three seconds or less. She moves her knight and sighs. She wins her chess match against Robert Winkel with checkmate in a shockingly short amount of time. She attends a mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is approached by Elliott and Benjamin, who accuse her of holding back during their practice games. She is hiding behind Elliott and Benjamin because she is scared of Robert Winkel. She stares blankly at Robert Winkel's marriage proposal, not understanding the situation. She is the object of Robert Winkel's affections because of her chess skills. She is being pursued by Robert Winkel for marriage, but declines his proposal. She is impressed by Robert's logical reasoning for wanting to marry her. She is attacked by Bernie, who reveals that he knows she is one of the Seven Sages. She is verbally attacked by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity and manipulating others. She is deeply hurt by Bernie's insults and struggles to defend herself. She realizes that Bernie hates her and is defended by Lana. She is reminded by Bernie that she is hiding her identity as one of the Seven Sages and that she is lying to Lana. She defends Lana against Bernie's insults, stating that she will no longer tolerate his behavior. She reveals her past desire to gain his approval and be a friend he could be proud of, but declares that she is done seeking his praise. She then turns her back on Bernie and walks away with Lana. She expresses her newfound strength and gratitude to Lana, attributing it to the corset and makeup. She is playing against Bernie in the chess competition. She returns to the competition room and finds Robert Winkel being punished by Felix and Cyril for his continued pursuit of her. She is frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel's punishment. She is surprised but not disturbed by Bernie's change of position in the chess match. She is calm and focused on the game, no longer seeking Bernie's approval. She is playing aggressively and destroying Bernie's plans. She defeats Bernie in chess with checkmate and shows no emotion towards him. She is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman and trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free from the water sphere using unchanted magecraft and defeats the fake Mr. Pitman with a mana-infused wind bullet. She thanks Ryn for telling her that Bernie was in danger. She asks Ryn to have Nero guard Felix. She believes that her fake life at the academy is over.",

            "brief_description": "The second son of Count Ambard, a noble in the Kingdom of Ridill. He is highly intelligent, ambitious, and skilled in magic, especially quick-chanting. Enrolling in Minerva's at age ten, his goal is to become one of the Seven Sages. He is protective of Monica, helping her with her studies and deciding to teach her quick-chanting to help her overcome her fear of public speaking, though he is aware of the bullying she endures but allows it to continue to ensure her dependence on him. He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but is now envious and feels betrayed by her unchanted magecraft, leading him to train recklessly and develop mana poisoning. He resents Monica's success and selection as one of the Seven Sages, and cruelly dismisses her attempts to thank him, reveling in her distress. He finds peace in the rumor that she is living as a hermit. Monica recalls his scornful eyes and hurtful words, blaming herself for their broken friendship. He introduced Monica to chess, but scorned it as a mere idle amusement. He is a representative from Minerva's in the chess competition. He is the son of Count Ambard and is representing Minerva's in the chess competition. He is politely cordial to Monica Norton, unaware that she is Monica Everett. He notes Monica Norton's resemblance to someone he used to know, who shares the same first name. He demands an answer from Monica Norton when she hesitates to answer his questions. He is intimidated by Nero and Ryn and apologizes for bothering Monica Norton before leaving. He is listening intently to the conversation between the teachers and is staring hard at Monica. He is glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is eating lunch and chatting cheerfully with the other students from Minerva's. Monica is trying to keep her distance from him. He attacks Monica with fire magic and reveals that he knows she is one of the Seven Sages. He confronts Monica, accusing her of hiding her identity and manipulating others. He insults her appearance and actions, causing her distress. He grabs Monica's hair and makes cruel remarks about her. He is confronted by Lana for cornering Monica in the hallway and making her cry. He is revealed to hate Monica. He accuses Monica of pretending to be helpless to take advantage of other people and claims that she is hiding her true identity and sponging off everyone else. He is revealed to be jealous of Monica. He is taken aback when Monica lashes out at him. He is left speechless when Monica declares that she is done trying to get his praise. He is determined to keep Monica thinking about him and seeks out Mr. Pitman to change the chess match order. He pressures Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to change the chess match order. He obtains Mr. Macragan's signature to change the chess match order so he can play against Monica. He is changing places with Elliott to play against Monica. He is determined to win against Monica at all costs, even if it means sacrificing pieces. He is defeated by Monica in chess. He is rude and unrefined, unworthy of a son of Count Ambard. He is frustrated and angry after losing to Monica. He is attacked by the fake Mr. Pitman, who is an imperial mage in disguise. He is saved by Monica. He attacks the fake Mr. Pitman with lightning arrows, but the mage deflects them. He is grabbed by the mage and unable to chant. He is rescued by Monica. He realizes Monica is on a secret mission to protect Prince Felix. He hides Ryn to protect Monica.",

He admits he didn't explain castling because he was being cocky and trying to win easily. He recalls his childhood resentment towards Felix due to his clumsiness and perceived incompetence. As a child, he teased Felix and caused him to fall from a tree, resulting in an injury and a scar. He initially felt guilty but was covered for by Felix.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        Nevertheless, he racked his brain, using all his knowledge to try and pin down what, exactly, he was seeing. It had very obviously induced a physical transformation. Magecraft that strengthened or changed the body was called body-manipulation magecraft. Because of its high risk of mana contamination, it was forbidden throughout the world. In recent years, however, one nation had reopened research on the topic. That nation was the empire to the east of the Kingdom of Ridill. ‚ÄúAre you from the Schwargald Empire?‚Äù demanded Bernie. The fake Pitman smiled without answering. If a mage from the Empire had swapped places with Pitman and infiltrated Serendia Academy, he was likely here to either assassinate or kidnap someone important. And the only person who fit that profile‚Äîwho was guaranteed to appear at the chess competition‚Äîwas‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs after Prince Felix! Bernie couldn‚Äôt overlook an intruder bent on harming the second prince. He had to stop this imperial mage‚Äôs scheme, whatever it took. Bernie began to chant, intending to use the most powerful spell in his arsenal, but the imperial mage launched into a sliding dash. He was fast. The man‚Äôs impossibly strong legs propelled him over to Bernie in the blink of an eye. He grabbed the boy‚Äôs neck with one hand, easily lifting him into the air. ‚ÄúGah‚Ä¶hah!‚Äù The false Pitman was a slender man of middling height‚ÄîBernie couldn‚Äôt imagine he had the strength to lift a person with only one hand. But the structure of the hand around Bernie‚Äôs neck was warped. His nails were longer, sharper. The arm itself rippled with unnatural muscle. Apparently, his skin wasn‚Äôt the only thing that had changed. Scales that could block magical attacks, combined with Herculean strength‚Ä¶ I see, thought Bernie. Dragonshifting indeed. He flailed his legs and dug his nails into the arm gripping his neck, but it wouldn‚Äôt budge. And worst of all, he couldn‚Äôt chant in this situation. He had to at least warn someone. The Eugene Pitman at Serendia was an imperial mage in disguise, using dangerous body-manipulation magecraft! ‚ÄúBernie?!‚Äù Suddenly, he heard a voice from behind him. He looked around using only his eyes to find Monica standing in the doorway. The imperial mage swore, then began quick-chanting a spell. ‚ÄúDrown and die!‚Äù Immediately, the ground at Monica‚Äôs feet began to glow. Then a sphere of water appeared, enclosing her.
Trapped by the bubble, Monica‚Äôs face warped in pain. Her mouth opened and closed pointlessly. The imperial mage sighed, irritated by the string of interruptions. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt have you screaming, you see. I‚Äôm sorry, young lady, but I need you to stay in there until you drown.‚Äù Monica struggled inside the sphere of water, bubbles spurting from her mouth. The sphere used a type of powerful internal barrier, and it was very difficult to escape once inside it. Even mages, unable to chant underwater, would have no choice but to wait for death. Mages who needed to chant, that is. There was a high-pitched noise like the sound of glass breaking. The imperial mage, confused, turned around‚Äîbut by then, the watery barrier enclosing Monica was already covered in cracks, letting the water drain out. ‚ÄúImpossible!‚Äù exclaimed the fake Pitman as the barrier completely burst, spraying water everywhere and releasing Monica to the floor. The girl coughed and coughed but managed to look up and face the imperial mage squarely. Behind her wet, messy bangs, her light-brown eyes glowed with just a hint of green. Wind created from mana blustered up around her. That wind then formed an invisible bullet that proceeded to strike the imperial mage right between his eyes. ‚ÄúGahhh, agh?!‚Äù The one weakness of dragons, which were otherwise highly resistant to magecraft, was the spot between their eyes‚Äîand apparently, the same rule applied to those using dragonshifting magecraft. The blow to his brow concussed the imperial mage. His eyes rolled up, and he fell over backward. Bernie, his neck freed from the mage‚Äôs grasp, fell to the floor, gasping for air. ‚ÄúBernie‚Ä¶ A-are you all right?!‚Äù He looked up to see Monica staring down at him, worry on her face. He sat and fixed his crooked glasses. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. More importantly, do you have any idea what‚Äôs going on‚Äî?‚Äù Before he could finish, he heard a tapping noise at the window. He looked over to see a small yellow bird perched outside the glass. Monica ran over and opened the window, letting the bird fly into the room. A moment later, it transformed into a person. This person was someone Bernie recognized. It was the blond man with the far-too-formal clothes. Apparently, he hadn‚Äôt been a man at all but a spirit.
‚ÄúYou have dealt with the assassin wonderfully, Silent Witch.‚Äù ‚ÄúMiss Ryn, thank you for telling me that Bernie was in danger.‚Äù Monica bowed to the blond spirit, then looked down at the imperial mage. ‚ÄúThis person may have been a decoy, so please continue to remain alert. And can you ask Nero to stay near the prince at all times, too?‚Äù ‚ÄúAt once.‚Äù After hearing Monica talk to the spirit, Bernie finally understood why she was here. She was an extremely shy person. She never would have enrolled in Serendia Academy of her own volition. He surmised she was on a mission to protect the second prince‚Äîa top secret one, no doubt. A mission that had demanded she enroll here. Monica wrung out her dripping wet skirt, then picked her glasses off the floor and put them in her pocket. The soaking wet girl with disheveled hair reminded him a lot of Everett the Mute back at Minerva‚Äôs, when her classmates had bullied her. She‚Äôd been sniffling and sobbing back then. But she was different now. Without shedding a single tear, she looked at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes?‚Äù he replied gruffly. Monica smiled, a tinge of loneliness to her expression. ‚ÄúIt looks like‚Ä¶this is the end of my fake life at the academy.‚Äù This attempted assassination would probably blow up into a huge incident. The real Eugene Pitman had probably been killed when the imperial mage took his place. With a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs as the victim, it would be impossible to cover up. Monica‚Äôs identity as the one who had captured him would soon be known far and wide, forcing her to leave the academy. Bernie could hear footsteps in the distance‚Äîprobably someone coming to check the waiting room. Ugh, fine! Without taking the time to think it over, Bernie called out. ‚ÄúHave that spirit turn back into a bird. Quickly!‚Äù ‚ÄúHuh? Um, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù As Monica stood there at a loss, not understanding his instruction, the spirit quickly returned to bird form. Bernie then hid the bird behind a shelf. Just as he finished, two people entered the waiting room. They were both members of the academy‚Äôs student council‚ÄîCyril Ashley and Neil Clay Maywood. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs all this?!‚Äù demanded Cyril. ‚ÄúOh no, oh no! Are you okay, Lady Norton?! You‚Äôre soaking wet!‚Äù cried Neil. The room was a mess.

        That final game would end soon, but Lana was much more concerned about Monica than the chess. After losing to her friend, Bernie Jones had run out of the room. Eventually, Monica had quietly left as well‚Äîprobably to go after him. Lana was worried that Bernie might take his anger out on her or say terrible things to her again. She knew Cyril and Neil had gone to check the waiting room, so she doubted much would happen, but she couldn‚Äôt shake the bad feeling in the pit of her stomach. Eventually, Neil returned. Instead of going back to his seat, though, he quickly walked over to Felix and whispered something in his ear. Is Vice President Ashley not with him? wondered Lana. The fact that Cyril wasn‚Äôt here and the grim expression on Neil‚Äôs face stirred her anxiety even more. Just then, the third match ended. Elliott Howard had won, meaning so had Serendia, with two victories and one defeat. A short break would follow, after which the University would play against Minerva‚Äôs. But just then, Felix stood up and made an announcement. ‚ÄúI apologize for the sudden interruption so soon after the end of the match. However, there‚Äôs something I need everyone to hear.‚Äù His usual smile was gone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve received word of an intruder in the academy.‚Äù Lana was stunned speechless. Everyone else was just as surprised‚Äîand they all looked uneasy. To calm them down, Felix softened his tone a little bit. ‚ÄúThere is no need for alarm. The intruder has already been captured, and security guards are on standby outside this room. But just to be sure, I‚Äôd like to have them patrol the campus, so would everyone please stay here for the time being?‚Äù The room erupted into chatter, but nobody panicked‚Äîthe prince had said there were security guards just outside the door, after all. Wait a minute, thought Lana. What about Monica? She‚Äôs not here. What happened to her? Just as she was about to ask, someone quietly came over to where she was seated‚ÄîNeil. ‚ÄúDo you have a moment?‚Äù he asked, beckoning to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn before lowering his voice and whispering, ‚ÄúLady Norton was at the scene of the intruder‚Äôs capture.‚Äù He then covered Glenn‚Äôs mouth just before the other boy shouted in surprise. It seemed he was becoming quite good at handling him. ‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù he continued.
‚ÄúFortunately, she isn‚Äôt injured, but she‚Äôs probably experiencing some shock‚Ä¶ Would you all go and be with her?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is she now?‚Äù asked Lana immediately. Neil spoke softly so that nobody else would hear. ‚ÄúThe infirmary.‚Äù And so Lana, Claudia, and Glenn snuck out of the room at Neil‚Äôs request and headed for the infirmary with security guards to escort them. ‚ÄúMonica, are you in there? We‚Äôre coming in, okay?‚Äù When they knocked on the infirmary door and peered inside, in place of the resident nurse, they found Monica sitting patiently in a chair‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶wearing nothing but a man‚Äôs jacket over her underwear. Lana wasted no time tackling Glenn and pushing him out of the room, leaving only her and Claudia inside, before shoving the door closed. ‚ÄúWhat was that for?!‚Äù the boy shouted from the hallway, but he wasn‚Äôt important right now. Monica didn‚Äôt seem particularly fazed by Glenn seeing her in her underwear. ‚ÄúOh, hi, Lana,‚Äù she said, remaining seated as she calmly looked up at her. Lana strode over to her friend and asked, her voice shaking, ‚ÄúWhose jacket is that?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril let me borrow it‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana buried her face in her hands and lifted her head toward the ceiling. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd always thought better of Vice President Ashley!‚Äù ‚ÄúL-Lana‚Ä¶?‚Äù stammered Monica. ‚ÄúAnd how could he leave a girl here in a state like this?!‚Äù wailed Lana. Monica lowered her gaze, unsure of what to do. The only calm one in the room, Claudia glanced at Monica‚Äôs dripping wet uniform hanging in the corner and murmured, ‚ÄúThat idiot‚Äôs not the type. I doubt he has the guts.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut isn‚Äôt that the only assumption you can make here?!‚Äù demanded Lana, her eyes bloodshot. Claudia pointed to the corner of the room, where Monica‚Äôs uniform hung. Lana looked at it, then blinked. ‚ÄúUm, it was very cold because my uniform was wet, so I took it off to dry it,‚Äù Monica murmured. ‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt know how to take the corset off by myself, so‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm glad you came along, Lana.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù Lana placed her hands on Monica‚Äôs shoulders and gave her a serious look. ‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre not injured?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd it doesn‚Äôt hurt anywhere?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Monica shook her head. Lana fell to the floor and heaved a sigh of relief.
After Lana helped her undo the corset, Monica removed her soaked-through underwear and changed into a simple set of pajamas she had borrowed from the infirmary. To tell the truth, she‚Äôd been very, very cold, so she grabbed a thin blanket from the bed and wrapped it around herself as well. Claudia silently held out a teacup. Apparently, she‚Äôd prepared her a warm drink. Monica gratefully took it and sipped its contents before her face twisted into a grimace. ‚ÄúI-it‚Äôth so thpithy‚Ä¶ Oof‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúIt has ginger, red pepper, and citrus peel in it. It‚Äôll warm you up.‚Äù The mixture had been made specifically to provide warmth, without much attention to taste. But Claudia was right‚Äîas Monica sipped at it, she felt heat permeating her body. She breathed a sigh. Glenn, who had eventually been allowed back into the room, asked her, ‚ÄúSo what happened anyway? The president said something about an intruder showing up.‚Äù Monica hesitated for a moment over how much to tell them. Apparently, the people at the chess competition had been informed of the intruder. Sooner or later, whatever info Monica had would be the subject of rumors. I should probably keep quiet about the imperial mage impersonating a teacher from Minerva‚Äôs, she thought. Thanks to Bernie‚Äôs quick thinking, everyone now considered Monica a mere victim who had just happened onto the scene. The intruder probably hadn‚Äôt realized she‚Äôd attacked him with unchanted magecraft, so as long as she and Bernie got their stories straight, she‚Äôd be able to go on with her life at the academy. But there was one thing she didn‚Äôt understand. Why did Bernie cover for me‚Ä¶? He‚Äôd been so hateful toward her and mocked her for pretending to be a student. But in the end, he‚Äôd lied to protect her identity. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life,‚Äù he‚Äôd said, smiling sardonically. But I was already grateful, thought Monica. Ever since we first met. I just don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶ She sighed to herself, then began to fumble through an explanation. ‚ÄúUm, so Bernie‚Ä¶I followed Minerva‚Äôs anchor into the waiting room, and he was fighting the intruder there‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúI see,‚Äù said Glenn. ‚ÄúAnd then you got wrapped up in it, yeah? Your clothes are soaked, too. Was it water magecraft or something?‚Äù ‚ÄúMm-hmm.

        Pitman was on the floor with his eyes rolled back in his head, Bernie had a bruise on his neck, and Monica was dripping wet. Something strange had clearly happened here. Cyril took off his jacket and put it around Monica‚Äôs shoulders, then asked Bernie, ‚ÄúBernie Jones of Minerva‚Äôs, explain those wounds.‚Äù He stared at the boy dubiously. The situation made it look a lot like Bernie had harmed Pitman and Monica. He couldn‚Äôt blame them for assuming as much. With an absolutely calm demeanor, he answered clearly and confidently. ‚ÄúIt appears someone has switched places with Eugene Pitman. When I saw through the disguise, he attacked me, and I fought him off. Lady Monica Norton happened to come into the waiting room at that very moment and got caught up in the fight.‚Äù Cyril and Neil were speechless at Bernie‚Äôs admission. Bernie glanced down at the mage who had turned himself into Pitman. ‚ÄúThis mage was using body-manipulation magecraft,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible he‚Äôs from the Empire.‚Äù The fact that someone had taken the place of a professor from Minerva‚Äôs and infiltrated Serendia Academy was troubling enough by itself. Add other nations into the mix, and the situation became much graver. Realizing this, Cyril‚Äôs expression grew serious. Addressing Neil, he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep watch over the scene and get the details from Bernie Jones. You inform the prince and the teachers.‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, sir!‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd bring Accountant Norton to the infirmary while you‚Äôre at it. I believe several of her friends were in the audience. Have them stay with her.‚Äù Neil nodded, then asked Monica if she could stand. Monica, still wearing Cyril‚Äôs jacket, glanced over at Bernie. ‚ÄúUm, Bernie, I‚Ä¶‚Äù Her eyes seemed to be asking him why he‚Äôd covered for her. Bernie gave her one of his usual sardonic smiles, fixed his glasses with a finger, and said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better keep thanking me for the rest of your life.‚Äù Cyril and Neil looked confused‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt understand the true meaning behind his words. But Monica gave Bernie a deep bow, then left the waiting room with Neil. The contest between Serendia Academy and Minerva‚Äôs saw a win for Monica in the first match and a win for Minerva‚Äôs in the second. Now only the anchors remained to decide which school would be victorious.

        "Monica returns Cyril's jacket, expressing her gratitude and guilt for his kindness while hiding her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",
        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate.",
        "Felix informs the student council that the intruder is uncooperative, the school festival will proceed with strengthened security, and orders them to rest before the workload increases. Cyril is anguished at being ordered to rest instead of helping.",
        "Duke Clockford reprimands Felix for the security breach and insists the school festival proceed to showcase Felix's worth and the duke's authority, especially with the inheritance decision looming. The student council, minus Felix, gathers to discuss the festival's fate following the intruder incident."

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security.

He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

He excels in his studies, is willing to defend commoners against noble bullies, is known for his quick-chanting abilities, and showed a protective and manipulative interest in Monica, wanting her to rely on him. He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but now feels betrayed and jealous of her unchanted magecraft abilities. He fails to become a Sage and harbors deep resentment towards Monica, blaming her for his misfortunes. He now actively seeks to hurt Monica and revels in her misery. He was the one who introduced Monica to chess, though he viewed it with disdain. He is now representing Minerva's at the chess competition. He smiles politely and acts sociable when meeting Monica Norton. He notices Monica's resemblance to someone he used to know. He questions Monica about how long she has been at Serendia Academy and is interrupted by Nero and Ryn. He is surprised by Nero and Ryn's sudden appearance, is intimidated by Ryn's enthusiasm, and apologizes before leaving. He is now glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is now attacking Monica with flame arrows and reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. He now confronts and insults Monica, accusing her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. He calls her a parasite and a dishonest cheat. He is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. He continues to insult Monica, accusing her of pretending to be helpless and taking advantage of others. He is jealous of Monica's talents and success. He is now confronted by Monica, who states she won't tolerate him speaking badly of Lana. He is taken aback by Monica's outburst and is left speechless as she declares she is done seeking his praise. He is disturbed by Monica's declaration that she no longer needs him and realizes he wants her to remain dependent on him. He seeks out Mr. Pitman. He manipulates Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to become the first player in the next match, aiming to play against Monica. He obtains Macragan's signature to change positions and play against Monica in the next match and plans to keep her in his thrall for eternity. He requests to change positions to play against Monica, which Elliott views as tasteless. He is defeated by Monica in chess and breaks down, leaving the room in anger and slamming his fist into the wall in the waiting room. He is now suspicious of Mr. Pitman's behavior and questions his identity. He now attacks the imposter Pitman with lightning arrows. He recognizes the imposter Pitman's magecraft as dragonshifting and identifies him as likely being from the Schwargald Empire. He is attacked and grabbed by the neck by the imposter Pitman. He realizes Monica is on a secret mission to protect the second prince. He instructs Ryn to transform back into a bird and hides him. He now covers for Monica, claiming that the imposter Pitman attacked him and that Monica was caught in the fight. He gives Monica a sardonic smile and tells her to keep thanking him.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        A little less than an hour passed before the door finally opened. ‚ÄúHey, everyone,‚Äù Felix called out as he entered the room. ‚ÄúSorry for making you wait so long.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir!‚Äù Cyril rose from his chair with a clatter. Elliott, resting his chin in his hand, grinned wryly and cast a sidelong glance at the prince. ‚ÄúEither way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to hold it like nothing happened, right?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou catch on quickly,‚Äù responded Felix with his usual calm demeanor before taking his own seat and looking around the room. ‚ÄúFirst of all, it seems the intruder at yesterday‚Äôs chess competition has not been very cooperative with our investigation. It will likely take some time before we can wring all the information we want out of him‚Äîhis employer, his objective, and the location of the real Mr. Pitman.‚Äù There was one thing in particular Monica had been curious about when it came to the intruder: How had the man seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman that none of the students from Minerva‚Äôs, including Bernie, realized immediately that he was a fake? He hadn‚Äôt put anything on his face or stuck any cotton into his oral cavity to adjust his silhouette or bone structure. Was he just eerily similar to the real Eugene Pitman to begin with? wondered Monica, perplexed. That seems awfully convenient‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe school festival will proceed as planned,‚Äù Felix continued. ‚ÄúHowever, we‚Äôll need to take a look at our security detail and strengthen it. I‚Äôll handle the review of our plans. I want the rest of you to continue preparing for the event as you have been.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, I will help with the review,‚Äù offered Cyril immediately. The prince shook his head. ‚ÄúThis is our last day off before the festival. Our workload is going to ramp up tomorrow, so I want you all to get a good rest today.‚Äù He looked at Cyril and added with a smile, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an order.‚Äù Cyril looked anguished to receive such an order from his esteemed prince. To him, not being able to help Felix must have been much more painful than taking on more work. He frowned and gritted his teeth. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Understood, sir,‚Äù he said eventually. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll rest for today so that I can dedicate my full efforts to aiding you tomorrow.‚Äù Then he groaned, trembling.
‚ÄúAs for all your work from tomorrow onward, I will ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to take things so seriously,‚Äù interrupted Felix. ‚ÄúMy work has been going smoothly.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, if anything happens, anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call on me. I swear that I shall‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.
As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.

        But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

        "Monica returns Cyril's jacket, expressing her gratitude and guilt for his kindness while hiding her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",
        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate.",
        "Felix informs the student council that the intruder is uncooperative, the school festival will proceed with strengthened security, and orders them to rest before the workload increases. Cyril is anguished at being ordered to rest instead of helping.",
        "Duke Clockford reprimands Felix for the security breach and insists the school festival proceed to showcase Felix's worth and the duke's authority, especially with the inheritance decision looming. The student council, minus Felix, gathers to discuss the festival's fate following the intruder incident."

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security. He dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased.",

He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

He excels in his studies, is willing to defend commoners against noble bullies, is known for his quick-chanting abilities, and showed a protective and manipulative interest in Monica, wanting her to rely on him. He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but now feels betrayed and jealous of her unchanted magecraft abilities. He fails to become a Sage and harbors deep resentment towards Monica, blaming her for his misfortunes. He now actively seeks to hurt Monica and revels in her misery. He was the one who introduced Monica to chess, though he viewed it with disdain. He is now representing Minerva's at the chess competition. He smiles politely and acts sociable when meeting Monica Norton. He notices Monica's resemblance to someone he used to know. He questions Monica about how long she has been at Serendia Academy and is interrupted by Nero and Ryn. He is surprised by Nero and Ryn's sudden appearance, is intimidated by Ryn's enthusiasm, and apologizes before leaving. He is now glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is now attacking Monica with flame arrows and reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. He now confronts and insults Monica, accusing her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. He calls her a parasite and a dishonest cheat. He is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. He continues to insult Monica, accusing her of pretending to be helpless and taking advantage of others. He is jealous of Monica's talents and success. He is now confronted by Monica, who states she won't tolerate him speaking badly of Lana. He is taken aback by Monica's outburst and is left speechless as she declares she is done seeking his praise. He is disturbed by Monica's declaration that she no longer needs him and realizes he wants her to remain dependent on him. He seeks out Mr. Pitman. He manipulates Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to become the first player in the next match, aiming to play against Monica. He obtains Macragan's signature to change positions and play against Monica in the next match and plans to keep her in his thrall for eternity. He requests to change positions to play against Monica, which Elliott views as tasteless. He is defeated by Monica in chess and breaks down, leaving the room in anger and slamming his fist into the wall in the waiting room. He is now suspicious of Mr. Pitman's behavior and questions his identity. He now attacks the imposter Pitman with lightning arrows. He recognizes the imposter Pitman's magecraft as dragonshifting and identifies him as likely being from the Schwargald Empire. He is attacked and grabbed by the neck by the imposter Pitman. He realizes Monica is on a secret mission to protect the second prince. He instructs Ryn to transform back into a bird and hides him. He now covers for Monica, claiming that the imposter Pitman attacked him and that Monica was caught in the fight. He gives Monica a sardonic smile and tells her to keep thanking him.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        A little less than an hour passed before the door finally opened. ‚ÄúHey, everyone,‚Äù Felix called out as he entered the room. ‚ÄúSorry for making you wait so long.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir!‚Äù Cyril rose from his chair with a clatter. Elliott, resting his chin in his hand, grinned wryly and cast a sidelong glance at the prince. ‚ÄúEither way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to hold it like nothing happened, right?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou catch on quickly,‚Äù responded Felix with his usual calm demeanor before taking his own seat and looking around the room. ‚ÄúFirst of all, it seems the intruder at yesterday‚Äôs chess competition has not been very cooperative with our investigation. It will likely take some time before we can wring all the information we want out of him‚Äîhis employer, his objective, and the location of the real Mr. Pitman.‚Äù There was one thing in particular Monica had been curious about when it came to the intruder: How had the man seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman that none of the students from Minerva‚Äôs, including Bernie, realized immediately that he was a fake? He hadn‚Äôt put anything on his face or stuck any cotton into his oral cavity to adjust his silhouette or bone structure. Was he just eerily similar to the real Eugene Pitman to begin with? wondered Monica, perplexed. That seems awfully convenient‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúThe school festival will proceed as planned,‚Äù Felix continued. ‚ÄúHowever, we‚Äôll need to take a look at our security detail and strengthen it. I‚Äôll handle the review of our plans. I want the rest of you to continue preparing for the event as you have been.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, I will help with the review,‚Äù offered Cyril immediately. The prince shook his head. ‚ÄúThis is our last day off before the festival. Our workload is going to ramp up tomorrow, so I want you all to get a good rest today.‚Äù He looked at Cyril and added with a smile, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an order.‚Äù Cyril looked anguished to receive such an order from his esteemed prince. To him, not being able to help Felix must have been much more painful than taking on more work. He frowned and gritted his teeth. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Understood, sir,‚Äù he said eventually. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll rest for today so that I can dedicate my full efforts to aiding you tomorrow.‚Äù Then he groaned, trembling.
‚ÄúAs for all your work from tomorrow onward, I will ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to take things so seriously,‚Äù interrupted Felix. ‚ÄúMy work has been going smoothly.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, if anything happens, anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call on me. I swear that I shall‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.

        FOLLOWING TEXT CHUNK:
        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.
As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.

        MAIN TEXT CHUNK:
        But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

        "Monica expresses her resolve to support the school festival as Accountant Norton to Cyril, who responds with a haughty yet appreciative demeanor. Felix reassures his spirit, Wildianu, that he will attend an event, relying on Wildianu's illusion magic to conceal his absence from Duke Clockford.",
        "Monica returns Cyril's jacket, expressing her gratitude and guilt for his kindness while hiding her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",
        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate.",
        "Felix informs the student council that the intruder is uncooperative, the school festival will proceed with strengthened security, and orders them to rest before the workload increases. Cyril is anguished at being ordered to rest instead of helping."

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration. She is now embarrassed and hunches over, playing with her fingers, after expressing her resolve to support the school festival to Cyril.",

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security. He dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. He is now chuckling at Cyril's voice from the hallway and is planning to attend an event.",

            "brief_description": "A student council secretary and the eldest son of Count Dasvy, who is a stickler for social hierarchy and dislikes Monica because she is a commoner. He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

He excels in his studies, is willing to defend commoners against noble bullies, is known for his quick-chanting abilities, and showed a protective and manipulative interest in Monica, wanting her to rely on him. He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but now feels betrayed and jealous of her unchanted magecraft abilities. He fails to become a Sage and harbors deep resentment towards Monica, blaming her for his misfortunes. He now actively seeks to hurt Monica and revels in her misery. He was the one who introduced Monica to chess, though he viewed it with disdain. He is now representing Minerva's at the chess competition. He smiles politely and acts sociable when meeting Monica Norton. He notices Monica's resemblance to someone he used to know. He questions Monica about how long she has been at Serendia Academy and is interrupted by Nero and Ryn. He is surprised by Nero and Ryn's sudden appearance, is intimidated by Ryn's enthusiasm, and apologizes before leaving. He is now glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is now attacking Monica with flame arrows and reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. He now confronts and insults Monica, accusing her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. He calls her a parasite and a dishonest cheat. He is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. He continues to insult Monica, accusing her of pretending to be helpless and taking advantage of others. He is jealous of Monica's talents and success. He is now confronted by Monica, who states she won't tolerate him speaking badly of Lana. He is taken aback by Monica's outburst and is left speechless as she declares she is done seeking his praise. He is disturbed by Monica's declaration that she no longer needs him and realizes he wants her to remain dependent on him. He seeks out Mr. Pitman. He manipulates Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to become the first player in the next match, aiming to play against Monica. He obtains Macragan's signature to change positions and play against Monica in the next match and plans to keep her in his thrall for eternity. He requests to change positions to play against Monica, which Elliott views as tasteless. He is defeated by Monica in chess and breaks down, leaving the room in anger and slamming his fist into the wall in the waiting room. He is now suspicious of Mr. Pitman's behavior and questions his identity. He now attacks the imposter Pitman with lightning arrows. He recognizes the imposter Pitman's magecraft as dragonshifting and identifies him as likely being from the Schwargald Empire. He is attacked and grabbed by the neck by the imposter Pitman. He realizes Monica is on a secret mission to protect the second prince. He instructs Ryn to transform back into a bird and hides him. He now covers for Monica, claiming that the imposter Pitman attacked him and that Monica was caught in the fight. He gives Monica a sardonic smile and tells her to keep thanking him.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        ‚ÄúAs for all your work from tomorrow onward, I will ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to take things so seriously,‚Äù interrupted Felix. ‚ÄúMy work has been going smoothly.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, if anything happens, anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call on me. I swear that I shall‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.
But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

        As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI shall now guide you to the estate of the Starseer Witch.‚Äù Monica had been invited to visit another of the Seven Sages‚Äîthe Starseer Witch Mary Harvey, the most talented prophet in the Kingdom of Ridill. CHAPTER 7 The Starseer Witch Mary Harvey‚Äôs Heart-Pounding Reading The Starseer Witch‚Äôs estate was about two hours by carriage from Serendia Academy, but with Ryn‚Äôs flight magecraft, it didn‚Äôt take much time at all. Monica arrived at the Harvey residence in the evening, just as the sun was setting; she‚Äôd asked Nero to stay behind in the attic room. ‚ÄúWelcome to my estate, Monica dear.‚Äù The voice welcoming her belonged to a silver-haired beauty reclining lazily on a long, cushioned bench. She had an odd aura about her and seemed to possess both the quiet calm of a mature lady and the girlish innocence of a dreamer. This was Mary Harvey, one of the Seven Sages and the greatest prophet in the land‚Äîand the very person who had invited Monica here. Wearing her Sage robes over a thin, revealing silk dress, she took a wineglass from a young servant standing beside her and downed its contents in one gulp. She had a number of servants bustling back and forth waiting on her‚Äîall young men in dress shirts and short pants cut off above the knees. It seemed that was the uniform here. Seated across from Mary was a man with long chestnut-colored hair tied up in a braid‚Äîthe Barrier Mage Louis Miller. He was downing his wine like it was water. He, too, wore his Sage robe and had his staff leaning against the long bench. That meant Monica had been called here on Seven Sages business. Louis placed his empty glass on the table, then turned to look at Monica and smiled. ‚ÄúWell, if it isn‚Äôt my esteemed colleague. Good evening. That dress suits you very well.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you again, Mr. Louis. Ummm, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù Monica looked back and forth between Mary and Louis as she stammered. She didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd been called here. But if Louis came, too, does that mean we‚Äôre facing a major problem that requires multiple Sages? ‚Ä¶Then again, both of them were elegantly drinking wine poured by good-looking young men. But then, why did they call me here? she thought, confused. Mary, smiling, gestured for Monica to sit.

        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.

        "Felix reassures Wildianu that he won't neglect his objective to engrave his name in history. Monica visits Isabelle, who invites her to the Bell-Ringing Festival in Corlapton, explaining the significance of bells and costumes in guiding the souls of the dead.",
        "Monica expresses her resolve to support the school festival as Accountant Norton to Cyril, who responds with a haughty yet appreciative demeanor. Felix reassures his spirit, Wildianu, that he will attend an event, relying on Wildianu's illusion magic to conceal his absence from Duke Clockford.",
        "Monica returns Cyril's jacket, expressing her gratitude and guilt for his kindness while hiding her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",
        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate."

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security. He dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. He is now chuckling at Cyril's voice from the hallway and is planning to attend an event. He is determined to engrave his name in history and won't forsake this objective.",

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration. She is now embarrassed and hunches over, playing with her fingers, after expressing her resolve to support the school festival to Cyril. She is now invited by Isabelle to attend the Bell-Ringing Festival in Corlapton.",

He dismisses Monica's offer to continue her student council work, stating they need to focus on chess to uphold the academy's reputation. He leaves the student council room after being teased by Elliott about losing to him in chess. He questions Monica about wearing glasses, as she doesn't have poor eyesight. He is now asked by Monica if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. He is now watching the chess game between Monica and Robert and asks Neil to silence Glenn. He is now watching Monica's chess game and questions if Monica would use the strategy of moving quickly to put pressure on her opponent. His expression changes abruptly while watching Monica's chess game. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He finds Monica and Bernie in the waiting room, with the imposter Pitman unconscious. He questions Bernie about the situation. He instructs Neil to inform the prince and teachers and to bring Monica to the infirmary with her friends. He is confused by Bernie and Monica's exchange. He now lends Monica his jacket. He is anguished at being ordered to rest instead of helping Felix. He is soothed by Felix's reassurance that he will be fine and that security has been increased. He is cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix. He is considerate and kind, despite his stern demeanor, and looks out for others. He is now grinning slightly at Monica's awkwardness and is prone to going a little overboard when it comes to Felix.",

            "brief_description": "A student council secretary and the eldest son of Count Dasvy, who is a stickler for social hierarchy and dislikes Monica because she is a commoner. He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

He believes Monica's talent could rival his own, but now feels betrayed and jealous of her unchanted magecraft abilities. He fails to become a Sage and harbors deep resentment towards Monica, blaming her for his misfortunes. He now actively seeks to hurt Monica and revels in her misery. He was the one who introduced Monica to chess, though he viewed it with disdain. He is now representing Minerva's at the chess competition. He smiles politely and acts sociable when meeting Monica Norton. He notices Monica's resemblance to someone he used to know. He questions Monica about how long she has been at Serendia Academy and is interrupted by Nero and Ryn. He is surprised by Nero and Ryn's sudden appearance, is intimidated by Ryn's enthusiasm, and apologizes before leaving. He is now glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is now attacking Monica with flame arrows and reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. He now confronts and insults Monica, accusing her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. He calls her a parasite and a dishonest cheat. He is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. He continues to insult Monica, accusing her of pretending to be helpless and taking advantage of others. He is jealous of Monica's talents and success. He is now confronted by Monica, who states she won't tolerate him speaking badly of Lana. He is taken aback by Monica's outburst and is left speechless as she declares she is done seeking his praise. He is disturbed by Monica's declaration that she no longer needs him and realizes he wants her to remain dependent on him. He seeks out Mr. Pitman. He manipulates Mr. Pitman and Lindsey Pail to become the first player in the next match, aiming to play against Monica. He obtains Macragan's signature to change positions and play against Monica in the next match and plans to keep her in his thrall for eternity. He requests to change positions to play against Monica, which Elliott views as tasteless. He is defeated by Monica in chess and breaks down, leaving the room in anger and slamming his fist into the wall in the waiting room.

He realizes Monica is on a secret mission to protect the second prince. He instructs Ryn to transform back into a bird and hides him. He now covers for Monica, claiming that the imposter Pitman attacked him and that Monica was caught in the fight. He gives Monica a sardonic smile and tells her to keep thanking him.",

      PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
      ‚ÄúAs for all your work from tomorrow onward, I will ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to take things so seriously,‚Äù interrupted Felix. ‚ÄúMy work has been going smoothly.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, if anything happens, anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call on me. I swear that I shall‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.
But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

      As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI shall now guide you to the estate of the Starseer Witch.‚Äù Monica had been invited to visit another of the Seven Sages‚Äîthe Starseer Witch Mary Harvey, the most talented prophet in the Kingdom of Ridill. CHAPTER 7 The Starseer Witch Mary Harvey‚Äôs Heart-Pounding Reading The Starseer Witch‚Äôs estate was about two hours by carriage from Serendia Academy, but with Ryn‚Äôs flight magecraft, it didn‚Äôt take much time at all. Monica arrived at the Harvey residence in the evening, just as the sun was setting; she‚Äôd asked Nero to stay behind in the attic room. ‚ÄúWelcome to my estate, Monica dear.‚Äù The voice welcoming her belonged to a silver-haired beauty reclining lazily on a long, cushioned bench. She had an odd aura about her and seemed to possess both the quiet calm of a mature lady and the girlish innocence of a dreamer. This was Mary Harvey, one of the Seven Sages and the greatest prophet in the land‚Äîand the very person who had invited Monica here. Wearing her Sage robes over a thin, revealing silk dress, she took a wineglass from a young servant standing beside her and downed its contents in one gulp. She had a number of servants bustling back and forth waiting on her‚Äîall young men in dress shirts and short pants cut off above the knees. It seemed that was the uniform here. Seated across from Mary was a man with long chestnut-colored hair tied up in a braid‚Äîthe Barrier Mage Louis Miller. He was downing his wine like it was water. He, too, wore his Sage robe and had his staff leaning against the long bench. That meant Monica had been called here on Seven Sages business. Louis placed his empty glass on the table, then turned to look at Monica and smiled. ‚ÄúWell, if it isn‚Äôt my esteemed colleague. Good evening. That dress suits you very well.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you again, Mr. Louis. Ummm, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù Monica looked back and forth between Mary and Louis as she stammered. She didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd been called here. But if Louis came, too, does that mean we‚Äôre facing a major problem that requires multiple Sages? ‚Ä¶Then again, both of them were elegantly drinking wine poured by good-looking young men. But then, why did they call me here? she thought, confused. Mary, smiling, gestured for Monica to sit.

      MAIN TEXT EXCERPT:
      ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.

        "Felix reassures Wildianu that he will not forsake his objective to engrave his name in history. Monica visits Isabelle, who invites her to the Bell-Ringing Festival in Corlapton, explaining its significance related to guiding the souls of the dead, with Agatha providing further details.",
        "Monica expresses her resolve to support the school festival as Accountant Norton to Cyril, who responds with a haughty yet appreciative demeanor. Felix reassures his spirit, Wildianu, that he will attend an event, relying on Wildianu's illusion magic to conceal his absence from Duke Clockford.",
        "Monica returns Cyril's jacket, expressing her gratitude and guilt for his kindness while hiding her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",
        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate."

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security. He dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. He is now chuckling at Cyril's voice from the hallway and is planning to attend an event. He is determined to engrave his name in history.",

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration. She is now embarrassed and hunches over, playing with her fingers, after expressing her resolve to support the school festival to Cyril. She is now visiting Isabelle and is invited to the Bell-Ringing Festival in Corlapton.",

He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

He was the one who introduced Monica to chess, though he viewed it with disdain. He is now representing Minerva's at the chess competition. He smiles politely and acts sociable when meeting Monica Norton. He notices Monica's resemblance to someone he used to know.

      PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
      ‚ÄúAs for all your work from tomorrow onward, I will ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to take things so seriously,‚Äù interrupted Felix. ‚ÄúMy work has been going smoothly.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, if anything happens, anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call on me. I swear that I shall‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.
But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

      As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI shall now guide you to the estate of the Starseer Witch.‚Äù Monica had been invited to visit another of the Seven Sages‚Äîthe Starseer Witch Mary Harvey, the most talented prophet in the Kingdom of Ridill. CHAPTER 7 The Starseer Witch Mary Harvey‚Äôs Heart-Pounding Reading The Starseer Witch‚Äôs estate was about two hours by carriage from Serendia Academy, but with Ryn‚Äôs flight magecraft, it didn‚Äôt take much time at all. Monica arrived at the Harvey residence in the evening, just as the sun was setting; she‚Äôd asked Nero to stay behind in the attic room. ‚ÄúWelcome to my estate, Monica dear.‚Äù The voice welcoming her belonged to a silver-haired beauty reclining lazily on a long, cushioned bench. She had an odd aura about her and seemed to possess both the quiet calm of a mature lady and the girlish innocence of a dreamer. This was Mary Harvey, one of the Seven Sages and the greatest prophet in the land‚Äîand the very person who had invited Monica here. Wearing her Sage robes over a thin, revealing silk dress, she took a wineglass from a young servant standing beside her and downed its contents in one gulp. She had a number of servants bustling back and forth waiting on her‚Äîall young men in dress shirts and short pants cut off above the knees. It seemed that was the uniform here. Seated across from Mary was a man with long chestnut-colored hair tied up in a braid‚Äîthe Barrier Mage Louis Miller. He was downing his wine like it was water. He, too, wore his Sage robe and had his staff leaning against the long bench. That meant Monica had been called here on Seven Sages business. Louis placed his empty glass on the table, then turned to look at Monica and smiled. ‚ÄúWell, if it isn‚Äôt my esteemed colleague. Good evening. That dress suits you very well.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you again, Mr. Louis. Ummm, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù Monica looked back and forth between Mary and Louis as she stammered. She didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd been called here. But if Louis came, too, does that mean we‚Äôre facing a major problem that requires multiple Sages? ‚Ä¶Then again, both of them were elegantly drinking wine poured by good-looking young men. But then, why did they call me here? she thought, confused. Mary, smiling, gestured for Monica to sit.

      ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.

        "Monica expresses her resolve to support the school festival as Accountant Norton to Cyril, who responds with a haughty yet appreciative demeanor. Felix reassures his spirit, Wildianu, that he will attend an event, relying on Wildianu's illusion magic to conceal his absence from Duke Clockford.",
        "Monica returns Cyril's jacket, expressing her gratitude and guilt for his kindness while hiding her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration.",
        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate.",
        "Felix informs the student council that the intruder is uncooperative, the school festival will proceed with strengthened security, and orders them to rest before the workload increases. Cyril is anguished at being ordered to rest instead of helping."

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration. She is now embarrassed and hunches over, playing with her fingers, after expressing her resolve to support the school festival to Cyril.",

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security. He dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. He is now chuckling at Cyril's voice from the hallway and is planning to attend an event.",

            "brief_description": "A student council secretary and the eldest son of Count Dasvy, who is a stickler for social hierarchy and dislikes Monica because she is a commoner. He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        ‚ÄúAs for all your work from tomorrow onward, I will ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to take things so seriously,‚Äù interrupted Felix. ‚ÄúMy work has been going smoothly.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, if anything happens, anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call on me. I swear that I shall‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.
But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

        As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI shall now guide you to the estate of the Starseer Witch.‚Äù Monica had been invited to visit another of the Seven Sages‚Äîthe Starseer Witch Mary Harvey, the most talented prophet in the Kingdom of Ridill. CHAPTER 7 The Starseer Witch Mary Harvey‚Äôs Heart-Pounding Reading The Starseer Witch‚Äôs estate was about two hours by carriage from Serendia Academy, but with Ryn‚Äôs flight magecraft, it didn‚Äôt take much time at all. Monica arrived at the Harvey residence in the evening, just as the sun was setting; she‚Äôd asked Nero to stay behind in the attic room. ‚ÄúWelcome to my estate, Monica dear.‚Äù The voice welcoming her belonged to a silver-haired beauty reclining lazily on a long, cushioned bench. She had an odd aura about her and seemed to possess both the quiet calm of a mature lady and the girlish innocence of a dreamer. This was Mary Harvey, one of the Seven Sages and the greatest prophet in the land‚Äîand the very person who had invited Monica here. Wearing her Sage robes over a thin, revealing silk dress, she took a wineglass from a young servant standing beside her and downed its contents in one gulp. She had a number of servants bustling back and forth waiting on her‚Äîall young men in dress shirts and short pants cut off above the knees. It seemed that was the uniform here. Seated across from Mary was a man with long chestnut-colored hair tied up in a braid‚Äîthe Barrier Mage Louis Miller. He was downing his wine like it was water. He, too, wore his Sage robe and had his staff leaning against the long bench. That meant Monica had been called here on Seven Sages business. Louis placed his empty glass on the table, then turned to look at Monica and smiled. ‚ÄúWell, if it isn‚Äôt my esteemed colleague. Good evening. That dress suits you very well.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you again, Mr. Louis. Ummm, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù Monica looked back and forth between Mary and Louis as she stammered. She didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd been called here. But if Louis came, too, does that mean we‚Äôre facing a major problem that requires multiple Sages? ‚Ä¶Then again, both of them were elegantly drinking wine poured by good-looking young men. But then, why did they call me here? she thought, confused. Mary, smiling, gestured for Monica to sit.

        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.

        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate.",
        "Felix informs the student council that the intruder is uncooperative, the school festival will proceed with strengthened security, and orders them to rest before the workload increases. Cyril is anguished at being ordered to rest instead of helping."

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity.

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security. He dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. He is now chuckling at Cyril's voice from the hallway and is planning to attend an event.",

He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

He was the one who introduced Monica to chess, though he viewed it with disdain. He is now representing Minerva's at the chess competition. He smiles politely and acts sociable when meeting Monica Norton. He notices Monica's resemblance to someone he used to know.

He is said to be unmatched among the students of his own country and insisted on being the first player despite his youth. He is tall, muscular, and looks like he'd be more at home swinging a sword than playing chess. He is now asking Monica to marry him so they can continue playing chess together. He explains his reasoning for proposing marriage to Monica, stating that he wants to play chess with her more often and believes that being engaged will provide a reason to meet. He is the fifth son of a baron in the Kingdom of Landor and plans to join the Knights of Landor. He is now sitting on the floor with a sign on his back that reads, 'Thinking about what I‚Äôve done'. He is now interrupted by Mr. Redding, Felix, and Cyril when he tries to speak to Monica.",

We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.
But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

        As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI shall now guide you to the estate of the Starseer Witch.‚Äù Monica had been invited to visit another of the Seven Sages‚Äîthe Starseer Witch Mary Harvey, the most talented prophet in the Kingdom of Ridill. CHAPTER 7 The Starseer Witch Mary Harvey‚Äôs Heart-Pounding Reading The Starseer Witch‚Äôs estate was about two hours by carriage from Serendia Academy, but with Ryn‚Äôs flight magecraft, it didn‚Äôt take much time at all. Monica arrived at the Harvey residence in the evening, just as the sun was setting; she‚Äôd asked Nero to stay behind in the attic room. ‚ÄúWelcome to my estate, Monica dear.‚Äù The voice welcoming her belonged to a silver-haired beauty reclining lazily on a long, cushioned bench. She had an odd aura about her and seemed to possess both the quiet calm of a mature lady and the girlish innocence of a dreamer. This was Mary Harvey, one of the Seven Sages and the greatest prophet in the land‚Äîand the very person who had invited Monica here. Wearing her Sage robes over a thin, revealing silk dress, she took a wineglass from a young servant standing beside her and downed its contents in one gulp. She had a number of servants bustling back and forth waiting on her‚Äîall young men in dress shirts and short pants cut off above the knees. It seemed that was the uniform here. Seated across from Mary was a man with long chestnut-colored hair tied up in a braid‚Äîthe Barrier Mage Louis Miller. He was downing his wine like it was water. He, too, wore his Sage robe and had his staff leaning against the long bench. That meant Monica had been called here on Seven Sages business. Louis placed his empty glass on the table, then turned to look at Monica and smiled. ‚ÄúWell, if it isn‚Äôt my esteemed colleague. Good evening. That dress suits you very well.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you again, Mr. Louis. Ummm, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù Monica looked back and forth between Mary and Louis as she stammered. She didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd been called here. But if Louis came, too, does that mean we‚Äôre facing a major problem that requires multiple Sages? ‚Ä¶Then again, both of them were elegantly drinking wine poured by good-looking young men. But then, why did they call me here? she thought, confused. Mary, smiling, gestured for Monica to sit.

        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.

        "As the headmaster convinced himself of this, Duke Clockford glanced back over to him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with Felix for a while.‚Äù The duke was asking him to leave, and the headmaster immediately stood to excuse himself from the room. He may have been the headmaster of the academy, but when Duke Clockford told you to get lost, you did as you were told. Once the headmaster was gone, Duke Clockford‚Äôs face warped ever so slightly ‚Äîinto something unpleasant and hateful. ‚ÄúA disgrace,‚Äù he spat lowly. Felix‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt waver, but it was no longer the gentle one from earlier‚Äîhis blue eyes like glowing beads of glass now looked upon the duke without any emotion whatsoever, like a puppet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been neglectful, not cautious enough of outsiders. That neglect directly led to this incident.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf I might have a word, Serendia Academy has long maintained a close relationship with both Minerva‚Äôs and the University. I believe being overly cautious would equate to rude‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúDo not talk back to me,‚Äù interrupted the duke, ice in his voice. ‚ÄúLords have been invited to the school festival. It will succeed. And you will show that rabble the worth of Felix Arc Ridill‚Äîand the might and authority of Duke Clockford.‚Äù The inheritance decision was upon them. In the near future, one of the king‚Äôs three sons would be named his heir. Felix needed to use this festival to show what he was made of. Understanding the duke‚Äôs implications, Felix quietly bent at the waist. Then, in a voice devoid of emotion, he answered. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Your Excellency.‚Äù The day after the chess competition would have normally been a day off, but the student council assembled anyway. The meeting would probably include an announcement about how things were to be handled following the incident with the intruder. Sitting snugly in her seat in the council room, Monica glanced around. Only Felix, the president, was missing. Apparently, the prince was currently in talks with teachers regarding the advisability of holding the school festival. The other council members were waiting for the results. Lady Claudia said the festival would go forward‚Ä¶, thought Monica, though it didn‚Äôt make much sense to her. Under normal circumstances, such an event would almost certainly be canceled or postponed. She and the other student council members all waited in their chairs, lost in thought.",
        "Felix dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. Monica waits for Cyril to return his jacket, and Ryn appears to invite the Silent Witch to someone's estate.",
        "Felix informs the student council that the intruder is uncooperative, the school festival will proceed with strengthened security, and orders them to rest before the workload increases. Cyril is anguished at being ordered to rest instead of helping."

            "brief_description": "A petite female student who recently transferred to Minerva's, now attending Serendia Academy under the alias Monica Norton as cover to infiltrate the school and protect the second prince. Initially perceived as gloomy and mute, she is a commoner who was initially harassed by nobles, but is saved by Bernie. She has stilted speech due to a long period of isolation, is quite poor, relies on Bernie for help, is bullied by her classmates, and struggles with public speaking. She has an exceptional understanding of magic formulae and can use wind and water magecraft without chanting, revealing her true genius. She becomes a scholarship student under Professor Rutherford and is later selected as one of the Seven Sages, becoming the youngest Sage in history. She is now seen wearing the robes and carrying the staff exclusive to Sages. She is still thin and appears childlike. She is currently a second-year student in Serendia Academy's advanced course, taking horseback riding and chess as electives. She is part of the student council. She is shy, hates being in front of others, and sometimes faints from nervousness. She has been holed up in a mountain cabin, doing magecraft research and numbers-related work. She was forced into a mission to guard the second prince, and is uncomfortable with etiquette, ballroom dancing, and other noble pursuits. She struggles with motor skills and balance. She is not afraid of horses, but is afraid of falling from high places. She is more afraid of people than horses. She is now learning about trotting. She wants to tell Casey that she learned to ride horses. She is currently observing Glenn Dudley's flight magecraft practice and Cyril Ashley's magic battles. She cannot use flight magecraft due to her poor balance. She is familiar with magic battles, having participated in them at Minerva's, and finds them painful and scary. She is reflecting on the kindness of her friends and colleagues and struggling to find a way to repay them. She is now attending chess class, having studied the rules beforehand. She is now invited to walk to chess class with Elliott Howard, which makes her uncomfortable. She is now questioned by Elliott for not calling him out on using castling without explaining it during their previous match. She explains that she agrees with someone who would criticize her for accepting a challenge based only on their own explanation and says she can't think of a reason to be angry at Elliott. Her chess game with Elliott ends in a stalemate. She observes that Elliott emphasizes the traditional roles of each piece, missing opportunities to promote pawns. She is now warned by Elliott about the dangers faced by talented commoners, which makes her anxious. She and Elliott have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition, which overwhelms her and reminds her of when Professor Rutherford forced her to participate in the Seven Sages' qualifiers. She reflects on wanting to tell her foster mother and a friend about becoming a Sage. She is currently depressed about being chosen for the chess competition. She is worried about causing trouble for Cyril due to the chess competition. She is grateful for Felix and Cyril's support. She has been borrowing chess books and playing chess to distract herself from insomnia after the incident with Casey. She is now challenged to a chess game by Felix, with a wish as the prize for winning, and is eager to win. She defeats Felix in chess. She is confronted by Elliott for holding back during their previous game and aiming for a stalemate. She asks Felix to stop calling her 'little squirrel', but Felix pinches her cheeks instead, stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. She recalls Louis Miller's lesson about defining terms. She is now chosen to be the anchor of the chess team, which overwhelms her. She is now terrified by the prospect of being made the anchor and recalls past failures. She learns that Neil was the anchor of the chess team last year and that Neil's chess style is unexpectedly merciless. Benjamin compares Felix's chess style to her own, describing it as precise and efficient. She is now trying to avoid Lana's invitation to go shopping because of the chess competition. She is relieved by Lana's positive reaction to her being on the chess team. She learns that the chess competition involves Minerva's, causing her to panic and hyperventilate due to past trauma. She blames herself for Bernie's actions and believes she is not supposed to be around people. She is now asked by Lana to come to her room the morning of the chess competition. She struggles with insomnia due to anxiety about facing students from Minerva's. She learns from Ryn that Casey has been sent to a convent after complying with the investigation into the assassination plot. She is now able to focus on chess, as Nero and Ryn are assigned to guard Felix during the chess competition and academy festival. She reflects on the complexities of politics and the various motives of individuals within factions and resolves to change her ways and confront the truth she's been avoiding. She acknowledges Felix's kindness and decides to ensure the chess competition and school festival proceed without incident. She is now instructing Nero and Ryn to be vigilant for suspicious conversations near Felix. She now realizes that Nero and Ryn's human forms appear to be in their mid-twenties, making them stand out if they wear student uniforms. She is now wearing a corset and having her makeup done by Lana. She is now having her makeup done by Lana to alter her appearance for the chess competition, and being fitted with glasses. She is surprised by how healthy she looks with makeup and glasses and is pleased that she no longer looks like a preteen. She is now about to have her hair curled by Lana. She is now complimented by Elliott on looking like a second-year student in the advanced course due to her makeover. She is pleased that she looks her age. She asks Cyril if she looks like she's good at chess while wearing glasses and is silent in response. She is pleased when Felix confirms that she looks like a student in the advanced course. She is now heading off with the other student council members to greet the students from the University and Minerva's, feeling anxious about facing her former school. She recalls Bernie introducing her to chess and his disdain for it. She is now meeting Bernie Jones at the chess competition. She shakes Bernie's hand and introduces herself as Monica Norton, managing to keep her composure. She is now questioned by Mr. Redding about her chess skills and freezes up, reciting pi. She retreats into reciting numbers to cope with stress and realizes appearance is a weapon in society. She now views her corset as a piece of armor and is determined to do her best in the chess competition. She is now approached by Bernie, who remarks on her resemblance to someone he used to know. She still wants to be Bernie's friend, even after he started to hate her. She is now saved from Bernie's questioning by Nero and Ryn. She is exhausted and feels a cold sweat covering her body after the encounter with Bernie. She asks Nero and Ryn to transform into a cat and bird. She is now anxious about whether Nero and Ryn are keeping watch as she instructed. She has been playing chess for two weeks. Her initial embarrassment at stuttering is quickly replaced by intense focus on the chessboard. She is now playing chess at an astonishing pace, making moves in three seconds or less. Her chess skills are now being observed by Felix and Bridget. She defeats Robert in a shockingly short chess match, declaring checkmate. She is now at the mixer hosted by the student council and tries to remain inconspicuous, keeping her distance from Bernie. She is accused by Elliott of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. She is now asked by Robert Winkel to marry him. She stares blankly, not understanding Robert's proposal. She declines Robert's proposal and flees, finding Robert's logical approach to marriage understandable. She is then attacked by Bernie, who reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages. She is now confronted and insulted by Bernie, who accuses her of hiding her identity, surrounding herself with men, and trying to curry favor with the second prince. She is deeply hurt by his accusations that she is a parasite and a dishonest cheat. She now realizes that Bernie hates her and wants nothing to do with her. She is now confronted by Lana, who questions his behavior towards Monica. She is now defended by Lana against Bernie's accusations, but fears that her secret identity will be revealed. She now defends Lana from Bernie's insults, stating she won't tolerate him speaking badly of her friend. She confesses she wanted Bernie's praise and to be a friend he could be proud of, but is now done seeking his approval. She turns her back on Bernie and leaves with Lana. She is now feeling stronger due to Lana's support and her altered appearance and expresses gratitude to Lana. She returns to the competition room after Lana refreshes her makeup and finds Robert Winkel sitting on the floor with a sign on his back. She is now a little frightened by the aura surrounding Robert Winkel. She is now sitting across from Bernie Jones. She is now no longer scared of Bernie and defeats him in chess, remaining emotionless even as he breaks down and leaves the room. She appears in the doorway as Bernie is being attacked by the imposter Pitman and is trapped in a sphere of water. She breaks free using unchanted magecraft and strikes the imposter Pitman with a wind bullet, incapacitating him. She is worried about Bernie's well-being. She thanks Ryn for alerting her to Bernie's danger. She instructs Ryn to remain alert and have Nero guard Felix. She is aware that her identity will soon be revealed, forcing her to leave the academy. She is now wearing Cyril's jacket and is asked by Neil if she can stand. She bows to Bernie, thanking him for covering for her. She was at the scene of the intruder's capture. She is now found by Lana, Claudia, and Glenn wearing only a man's jacket over her underwear and explains that she removed her wet uniform and couldn't remove her corset by herself. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she followed Bernie into the waiting room and got caught in a fight with the intruder, who used water magecraft. She is grateful for Bernie covering for her despite his previous hateful behavior. She explains to Lana, Claudia, and Glenn that she was trapped in a water bubble spell, which is why her uniform was soaked. She reflects on her misfortune and terrible luck. She is now unsettled by Claudia's statement that Felix is Duke Clockford's puppet. She is now waiting with the other student council members for Felix to return from his meeting. She wonders how the imposter Pitman seemed so much like the real Eugene Pitman. She waits for Cyril to return his jacket and is visited by Ryn, who invites the Silent Witch to someone's estate. She stumbles over her words when thanking Cyril for lending her his jacket and feels guilty about lying about her true identity. She resolves to contribute to the success of the school festival as Accountant Norton to repay his consideration. She is now embarrassed and hunches over, playing with her fingers, after expressing her resolve to support the school festival to Cyril.",

He is slender, but has strong arms. He is teaching Monica how to trot. He is perceptive of Monica's feelings and actions. He makes sure to take horseback riding class every year. He is knowledgeable about magecraft and takes Monica to observe advanced practical magecraft classes. He seems to enjoy watching Glenn and Cyril practice magecraft. He notes that Cyril is up against the president of the magic-battle club and believes Cyril is the strongest student at the academy. He claims he chose horseback riding to secretly observe practical magecraft classes for his studies, but Monica suspects there may be other reasons. As a child, he was frail, clumsy, and had terrible motor skills. He was shy and struggled to speak in front of others. He was knowledgeable about astronomy. As a child, he injured himself attempting to retrieve his astronomy book from a tree after Elliott hid it. He covered for Elliott after Elliott caused him to fall from a tree and impale himself on a branch, claiming it was his own fault for not knowing how to climb. He is happy that Monica and Elliott are participating in the chess competition and offers to reduce their student council work. He participated in the chess competition last year and was supported by the student council. He reassures Monica about her selection for the chess competition. He retrieves a chessboard. He offers Monica a chess game with a wish as a prize for winning. He is amused by Monica's eagerness and schemes to lose while trying to figure out what she wants, feeling a bit jealous of her growing closeness with Cyril. He is defeated by Monica in chess, despite holding back. He pinches Monica's cheeks when she asks him to stop calling her 'little squirrel', stating that she didn't specify what she wanted to be called instead. He is known for being under the thumb of his maternal grandfather, Duke Clockford. He praises Monica's refined and lovely appearance, confirming that she looks like a student in the advanced course. He is now observing Monica's chess skills and finds himself quite fascinated. He intervenes in Robert's pursuit of Monica after Robert's marriage proposal. He announces the capture of an intruder at the academy and asks everyone to stay in the room while security patrols the campus. He is now being reprimanded by Duke Clockford for being neglectful and causing the security breach. He informs the student council that the school festival will proceed with strengthened security. He dismisses the student council, reassuring Cyril that he will be fine and that security has been increased. He is now chuckling at Cyril's voice from the hallway and is planning to attend an event.",

            "brief_description": "A student council secretary and the eldest son of Count Dasvy, who is a stickler for social hierarchy and dislikes Monica because she is a commoner. He invites Monica to walk to chess class with him, making her uncomfortable. He used castling to win their previous chess match without explaining the rule to Monica and is now questioning why she didn't call her out for it. He admits he didn't explain castling because he thought she wouldn't understand and he was being cocky. He recalls his first meeting with Felix, whom he disliked due to his clumsiness and incompetence, and is reminded of this memory by Monica's similar reaction when he asked her why she wasn't angry at him for using castling. He hid Felix's astronomy book in a tree, leading to Felix injuring himself while trying to retrieve it. He warns Monica about the dangers faced by talented commoners, revealing that his uncle was betrayed by his commoner wife, leading to his suicide. He realizes Felix is fond of Monica because she shares a similar sentiment to Felix, accepting blame for things that aren't her fault. He analyzes Monica's merciless, logical chess playing style, where she values all pieces equally and is willing to sacrifice the king for a win. He admits he hates upstarts, which is why he didn't promote his pawn. He now acknowledges Monica's exceptional talents but still warns her about the dangers of being envied or exploited. He and Monica have been chosen to represent Serendia Academy in the upcoming chess competition. He observes Monica's unhappiness about being chosen for the chess competition. He agrees with Cyril that Monica should focus on chess and not take on extra work. He teases Cyril about losing to him in chess. He realizes that Monica held back during their chess game and confronts her about it, pinching her cheek. He describes Benjamin Mording as an artist who goes on and on once he gets started. He suggests sticking with the original chess team order, with himself as the anchor, but looks depressed. He notes that Monica looks like a second-year student in the advanced course after her makeover. He tries to lighten the mood when Monica freezes up, but is unsuccessful. He now understands why he was made the anchor of the chess team and is exhausted by Monica and Benjamin. He lost his chess game against the University. He accuses Monica of holding back during their practice matches and using unorthodox tactics in the competition. He finds Robert's self-centeredness refreshing. He tells Monica to pretend she doesn't see Robert Winkel and not to ask what happened while she was out of the room. He narrows his eyes at Bernie when Bernie switches seats with him. He surmises that Bernie was the one who requested the change in seating arrangement. He is now informed that the school festival will proceed as planned.",

He fails to become a Sage and harbors deep resentment towards Monica, blaming her for his misfortunes. He now actively seeks to hurt Monica and revels in her misery. He was the one who introduced Monica to chess, though he viewed it with disdain. He is now representing Minerva's at the chess competition. He smiles politely and acts sociable when meeting Monica Norton. He notices Monica's resemblance to someone he used to know. He questions Monica about how long she has been at Serendia Academy and is interrupted by Nero and Ryn. He is surprised by Nero and Ryn's sudden appearance, is intimidated by Ryn's enthusiasm, and apologizes before leaving. He is now glaring at Monica with dark eyes. He is now attacking Monica with flame arrows and reveals his knowledge of her true identity as one of the Seven Sages.

He obtains Macragan's signature to change positions and play against Monica in the next match and plans to keep her in his thrall for eternity.

        PRECEDING TEXT CHUNK:
        ‚ÄúAs for all your work from tomorrow onward, I will ‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need to take things so seriously,‚Äù interrupted Felix. ‚ÄúMy work has been going smoothly.‚Äù ‚ÄúSir, if anything happens, anything, please don‚Äôt hesitate to call on me. I swear that I shall‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine. We‚Äôve increased security starting today, after all.‚Äù Once Felix managed to soothe Cyril into reluctant agreement, they were all dismissed for the day. As the rest of them left the student council room, Cyril took an awful long time cleaning up the papers on his desk, fidgeting and glancing at Felix as he did so. Monica needed to tell him something, so she waited for him outside in the hallway. She wanted to return the jacket he‚Äôd lent her during the chess competition. ‚ÄúThank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for lending me your jacket yesterday, thank you for‚Ä¶‚Äù As she quietly muttered words of gratitude to herself, practicing to make sure she wouldn‚Äôt fumble them, a little bird fluttered in from the window. The creature, covered in vivid golden feathers, came to a stop on Monica‚Äôs shoulder. Monica, however, was so preoccupied with practicing her thanks that she didn‚Äôt even notice. ‚ÄúSilent Witch?‚Äù ‚ÄúHyah-what?!‚Äù yelped Monica at the sudden voice in her ear. She looked over at the bird on her shoulder‚ÄîRyn. If Ryn was risking talking to her inside the school building, it must have been urgent. Monica made sure nobody was around, then asked, ‚ÄúIs this about yesterday?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôve come on other business today.‚Äù There‚Äôs other business? thought Monica, caught off guard. ‚Äú would like to invite the Silent Witch to her estate,‚Äù Ryn said in a whisper. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Huh?‚Äù Monica‚Äôs eyes widened at the unexpected name. Just then, she heard footsteps on the other side of the door. Cyril had probably given up and was about to leave. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come get you later,‚Äù said Ryn before quickly flying back out the window. Not a moment after, the door opened, and Cyril came out. When he noticed Monica there, he looked surprised. He probably hadn‚Äôt expected her to wait in the hallway like this. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù ‚ÄúH-hello!‚Äù After her short talk with Ryn, she‚Äôd completely forgotten the phrase she‚Äôd just been practicing.
She held out the paper-wrapped object she‚Äôd been clutching to her chest and mumbled, ‚ÄúUm, Lord Cyril, er‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ Thank you for, er, your jacket yephterday!‚Äù All her practice had been for naught‚Äîshe‚Äôd fumbled the whole thing. Flushing up to her ears, she began to tremble. ‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù said Cyril, as though he was only now recalling giving her the jacket. He took it from her. Thank goodness. I managed to thank him and return it‚Ä¶ Even though I choked. Monica privately sighed in relief, then shyly muttered, ‚ÄúIt, um, seems like I‚Äôm always borrowing your jacket, Lord Cyril.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶? Are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúUm, like the day we were overseeing the supplies‚Ä¶‚Äù After Casey‚Äôs assassination attempt, Monica had cried a lot, then fallen asleep. When she‚Äôd woken up, she‚Äôd found Cyril‚Äôs jacket lying on top of her. Thinking about it made her feel pangs of guilt in the pit of her stomach. ‚ÄúAccountant Norton?‚Äù He‚Äôs being so considerate to me because he doesn‚Äôt know the truth‚Ä¶ Cyril must have thought of her as a victim simply caught up in the previous day‚Äôs incident, just as he had that day with the lumber. That was why he was worried about her. He always said stern things, but he was a kind person who looked out for others, even if he didn‚Äôt show it. And every time he was kind to her, a little more guilt welled up in her heart for lying about her true identity. Is there anything I can do to repay him? She couldn‚Äôt tell him who she was. The moment she did, the curtains would close on her pretend school life. Instead of doing something for him as the Silent Witch, she wanted to do something for him as Accountant Norton of the student council. What can I do for him as a council member‚Ä¶? she wondered. Then she straightened up and met his gaze. ‚ÄúUm, Lord C-Cyril!‚Äù she stammered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll, um, do my very best, so‚Ä¶‚Äù She‚Äôd do her very best‚Äîhow vague and unreliable those words must have sounded. But it didn‚Äôt matter. She wanted desperately to convey her intentions to him‚Äîto tell him what she could do as Accountant Norton. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do everything we can to, um, make the school festival a success. Okay?‚Äù Somehow, she managed to get the whole thing out.
But right after she finished, embarrassment overcame her, and she hunched back over and began to play with her fingers. She heard a short exhalation from above‚Äîa laugh, perhaps. Hunched over now, she glanced up through her bangs and saw Cyril grinning slightly. ‚ÄúNaturally,‚Äù he responded in a very haughty, Cyril-like way. It made her strangely happy. Same old Cyril‚Ä¶, she thought, an awkward smile appearing on her face. Then Cyril glanced back at the student council room, and his arrogant demeanor quickly disappeared, replaced by a look of anguish. ‚ÄúAnd this is exactly when we should be putting forth every effort,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo why am I not at his side right now? ‚Ä¶Ugh. He‚Äôs working, and yet I must rest‚Ä¶?‚Äù ‚ÄúLord Cyril, tomorrow! We‚Äôll help him tomorrow!‚Äù This was the same old Cyril Monica knew‚Äîbold and strong-willed, and prone to going a little overboard when it came to Felix. Hearing Cyril‚Äôs voice from the hallway, Felix chuckled and wet his pen in his inkwell. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt need to worry so much. This is practically a break compared to my other work.‚Äù As if to answer him, his water spirit, Wildianu, in the form of a white lizard, crawled out from his uniform pocket. When Wildianu attempted to use his tiny limbs to clamber over to the desk, the prince stopped writing and lifted the lizard up on his finger, depositing him at his destination. ‚ÄúAnd once I finish this work, I‚Äôll take a little break myself.‚Äù Wildianu looked up at him with his small light-blue eyes. Lizards‚Äô faces couldn‚Äôt express emotion the way human faces could, but somehow Felix got the sense the spirit was troubled. ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù said Wildianu, ‚Äúare you truly going?‚Äù ‚ÄúThis day only comes once a year,‚Äù replied Felix. ‚ÄúMind the place while I‚Äôm gone, will you?‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you go out at night too often, it‚Äôs bound to draw the attention of Duke Clockford‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs why I have you.‚Äù Wildianu was a high water spirit. He wasn‚Äôt skilled at combat or detection, but he was very adept when it came to illusion magic. Whenever Felix snuck out, Wildianu would stay behind and use magic to fool everyone else into thinking the prince was still there. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a talented ally like you,‚Äù said Felix. Wildianu looked up at him like he wanted to say something.

        As a result, the souls of the dead are able to cross through the gates of the underworld and wander back into this one.‚Äù The underworld watchman was the King of the Earth Spirits‚Äôs underling. He was an eerie creature who possessed black claws and wings and wore a white mask over his face. He was depicted in quite terrifying ways in books for children, and adults would use him to warn their sons and daughters against bad behavior‚Äîif they didn‚Äôt behave, the underworld watchman would chase them down for all eternity. But if he was willing to leave his post to secretly enjoy a festival, perhaps he wasn‚Äôt as inhuman as people believed. ‚ÄúWhen the festival ends, the watchman and the souls of the dead return to the underworld. The bells are used to show them the way back to where they belong.‚Äù Isabelle nodded firmly at Agatha‚Äôs explanation and held up the bell in her hand. ‚ÄúThat is why animal costumes and bells are essential for autumn festivals in the east!‚Äù She went on to tell Monica that while she was the daughter of a count, every year on this day she would dress up and sneak into the festival with Agatha. Monica listened to Isabelle‚Äôs and Agatha‚Äôs cheerful explanations, her eyes downcast. She felt awful about it, since Isabelle seemed so excited, but she had other plans she couldn‚Äôt get out of. ‚ÄúUm, Lady Isabelle, I‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know, I wanted so badly to go to the chess competition and cheer you on from the very front row! As the villainess in your story, however, it was simply not possible. But if we‚Äôre at an event outside the academy, there will be no problems! In fact, since everyone dresses up for the Bell-Ringing Festival, it‚Äôs perfect for having some fun in secret!‚Äù Oh no, thought Monica, feeling even worse. Her voice was quiet as she spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really sorry, Lady Isabelle. I have something, um, to do after this‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle stopped moving entirely. She remained frozen for a few seconds, then quietly removed her wildcat hood. Her face flushed, as though she was embarrassed over having been so excited, and she murmured, ‚ÄúNo, I apologize for getting ahead of myself. You have such an important mission, and yet I‚Äôm acting like this‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiny tears began to form in Isabelle‚Äôs big eyes.
She‚Äôs helped me out more times than I can count, and I can‚Äôt even do this for her! thought Monica. Feeling pangs of guilt in her heart, she squeezed out a few more words. ‚ÄúUm, if I ever, well, end up going to Kerbeck‚Ä¶I want to go to a festival with you. You‚Äôve helped me so much, so, um, I want to do everything I can to repay you!‚Äù Once she was finished speaking, she paled. Was she bothering Isabelle with her suggestion? Was she being rude somehow? But her fears were unfounded. ‚ÄúRepayment? Oh, I could never! We owe you so much, my sister. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of asking anything of you in return! Still‚Ä¶‚Äù Isabelle‚Äôs head came back up. Her eyes were glittering. ‚ÄúWhen festival season comes again, please, by all means, visit Kerbeck! I will do everything in my power, absolutely everything, to make sure you have a good time! Oh, and we should wear matching costumes! We can make you a cute staff with a bell‚Ä¶ Oh! And there‚Äôs this traditional baked sweet, and it‚Äôs said that if you split it with a friend and eat it, you‚Äôll be friends forever!‚Äù As Isabelle excitedly listed off the possibilities, Agatha watched her with the face of a kind older sister. ‚ÄúThat sounds delightful, my lady.‚Äù Monica returned to her room and took off her uniform, then changed into the navy dress Louis had given her. Considering who she was about to see, her Sage attire might have been more fitting. But she hadn‚Äôt needed her robes or staff for her mission, so she‚Äôd left them back in her mountain cabin. The dress Louis had sent wasn‚Äôt meant for balls, only minor outings, but it was the most respectable thing she had in terms of personal clothing. To finish the outfit, Monica put on her white coat, also from Louis, then twirled around in place. ‚ÄúDoes it look good on me, Nero?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, you bet it does. Anyway, where are you going?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell‚Äî‚Äù Just then, they heard a knocking at the window. Monica went over and opened it, letting in a little golden bird. The bird landed on the ground and took the form of a beautiful blond-haired maid. Rynzbelfeid, contracted spirit of the Barrier Mage Louis Miller, picked up the hem of her skirt and curtsied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come to fetch you,‚Äù she said.
‚ÄúI shall now guide you to the estate of the Starseer Witch.‚Äù Monica had been invited to visit another of the Seven Sages‚Äîthe Starseer Witch Mary Harvey, the most talented prophet in the Kingdom of Ridill. CHAPTER 7 The Starseer Witch Mary Harvey‚Äôs Heart-Pounding Reading The Starseer Witch‚Äôs estate was about two hours by carriage from Serendia Academy, but with Ryn‚Äôs flight magecraft, it didn‚Äôt take much time at all. Monica arrived at the Harvey residence in the evening, just as the sun was setting; she‚Äôd asked Nero to stay behind in the attic room. ‚ÄúWelcome to my estate, Monica dear.‚Äù The voice welcoming her belonged to a silver-haired beauty reclining lazily on a long, cushioned bench. She had an odd aura about her and seemed to possess both the quiet calm of a mature lady and the girlish innocence of a dreamer. This was Mary Harvey, one of the Seven Sages and the greatest prophet in the land‚Äîand the very person who had invited Monica here. Wearing her Sage robes over a thin, revealing silk dress, she took a wineglass from a young servant standing beside her and downed its contents in one gulp. She had a number of servants bustling back and forth waiting on her‚Äîall young men in dress shirts and short pants cut off above the knees. It seemed that was the uniform here. Seated across from Mary was a man with long chestnut-colored hair tied up in a braid‚Äîthe Barrier Mage Louis Miller. He was downing his wine like it was water. He, too, wore his Sage robe and had his staff leaning against the long bench. That meant Monica had been called here on Seven Sages business. Louis placed his empty glass on the table, then turned to look at Monica and smiled. ‚ÄúWell, if it isn‚Äôt my esteemed colleague. Good evening. That dress suits you very well.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you again, Mr. Louis. Ummm, ummm‚Ä¶‚Äù Monica looked back and forth between Mary and Louis as she stammered. She didn‚Äôt know why she‚Äôd been called here. But if Louis came, too, does that mean we‚Äôre facing a major problem that requires multiple Sages? ‚Ä¶Then again, both of them were elegantly drinking wine poured by good-looking young men. But then, why did they call me here? she thought, confused. Mary, smiling, gestured for Monica to sit.

        ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no need for concern,‚Äù said Felix serenely to his worrywart spirit. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt forsake my most important objective.‚Äù He closed his pale eyelids, before slowly opening them again. A dark light of determination sparkled in his beautiful eyes, sky blue with just a hint of green in them. ‚ÄúTen years ago, I swore to engrave the name Felix Arc Ridill in history. And I have never wavered in that oath, as I‚Äôm sure you know.‚Äù He smiled darkly. Wildianu bowed his head. ‚ÄúIt will be done, Master,‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúMonica! Oh, my sister! We simply must go to the festival in Corlapton!‚Äù Intending to report on the events of the last several days, Monica had gone to visit Isabelle‚Äîher collaborator in her mission to guard the second prince. When she arrived, the younger girl had rung a little bell, a big smile on her face, and suggested they head out. As she jingled the bell, Monica noticed she was wearing a hood with wildcat ears over one of her dresses. Monica tilted her head in confusion at the odd outfit. ‚ÄúUmmm, Corlapton‚Ä¶?‚Äù she ventured. ‚ÄúA town to the east of the academy. Tonight, they are holding the Bell-Ringing Festival!‚Äù With autumn‚Äôs arrival, harvest and fertility festivals were held all across the Kingdom to give thanks to the King of the Earth Spirits, Archraedo. Every region had their own unique take on these festivals. Monica had heard once that in the eastern region, since it was believed that the creatures of the land were Archraedo‚Äôs servants, people would wear costumes or headdresses in their likeness. That must be why Isabelle was wearing the wildcat hood. But this business about ringing bells was new to Monica. ‚ÄúWhat does ringing the bells represent?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúThe bells are meant to guide the souls of the dead.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe souls of the dead?‚Äù Monica looked dubious. That didn‚Äôt have anything to do with harvests or bumper crops. Isabelle‚Äôs maid, Agatha, explained as she prepared their tea. ‚ÄúIn the eastern lands, there is a legend that on festival nights, the watchman of the underworld gets so jealous of the humans‚Äô fun, he leaves his post and sneaks into the festivities.
